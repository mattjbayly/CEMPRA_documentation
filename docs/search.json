    "text": "Many species are under significant pressure from human development and resource use. These effects are coupled with existing pressures from climate change and natural disturbances. Collectively, these pressures can compound and interact to have cumulative effects on many species and ecosystems. Attempts have been made to quantify, map, and model cumulative effects across a landscape or region of interest to understand current conditions, high vs low-risk areas, and potential future conditions under different (hypothetical) development scenarios. However, the applicability of many analytical tools and frameworks is often constrained to specific geographies, study systems or regulatory requirements. In addition, many tools or frameworks are either too specific or over-generalized to be broadly transferable, causing researchers to develop their own models from scratch and duplicate efforts when undertaking cumulative effects (CE) assessments. In addition, most CE modelling tools merely rank the severity of local stressors using an additive or multiplicative scoring system based on the co-occurrence of multiple stressors (e.g., (Halpern & Fujita, 2013)). While this provides a useful index of local stressor magnitude, it provides limited insight into how ecological values will respond to stressor reduction, which requires predictive stressor-response functions.\nThe CEMPRA tool leverages (and automates) common data processing and analytical pathways reoccurring across numerous cumulative effects assessments. The development team behind the CEMPRA tool also recognizes that many cumulative effects assessments are collaborative and highly iterative. As such, an interactive web application was developed alongside an analytical R-package to facilitate the development of cumulative effects assessments in a workshop-like setting. The CEMPRA R-Shiny web application facilitates the inclusion and leadership of land stewards and decision-makers in the assessment and analytical process by working around a centralized interactive choropleth (heat) map. Key locations are represented by polygons on the map linked to interactive stressors and stressor-response relationships. Numerous interactive visualizations and summary tables are included within the tool to facilitate rapid “what if” scenario assessments. The CEMPRA tool does not include all possible options for advanced analytics. However, it can be a useful starting point to engage different user groups and work towards a shared understanding of key drivers, processes and opportunities for a target study system and region of interest.\nThe inspiration for the CEMPRA tool originated from many case studies centred around aquatic species-at-risk in Canada and is based on the Alberta Cumulative Effects model ((L. MacPherson et al., 2020), (L. M. MacPherson et al., 2023)). However, the underlying framework is not explicitly bound to aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems have remained the primary focus of the CEMPRA tool’s development in response to numerous contemporary priorities, including a) practical guidance for watershed management, b) recent amendments to the Fisheries Act prompting the consideration of cumulative effects (past and current), c) empowering practitioners with tools and resources to initialize collaborative cumulative effects assessments.\nKey components of the CEMPRA include a focal study system (e.g., a target population), a focal area of interest (i.e., a target region with defined sub-areas, locations, or spatial units with different stressor levels), key stressors of interest (e.g., stream temperature, sedimentation, habitat loss), stressor-response functions linking key stressors to the focal population or species of interest, estimates of stressor magnitude levels across the target region of interest (e.g., current stressor conditions in the different spatial units), and different assessment endpoints (i.e., either the single-stage Joe model output or the life cycle model output) for data-rich and data-limited systems, and scenarios to represent in the model (i.e., future “what if” possibilities or alternative management scenarios).\nCore Components of the CEMPRA Tool:\nUnlike most CE models that score (weight) multiple stressors to generate an index of overlapping stressor levels at a given location ((Halpern & Fujita, 2013)), CEMPRA goes one step further to estimate the impact of a given stressor level on a target ecological response in any given spatial unit, based on local stressor levels. This “Joe” model structure requires the following components:\nStudy System: In all applications of the CEMPRA tool, users should frame their assessment around a focal study system. Previous (and ongoing) applications of the Joe/CEMPRA model have included Athabasca Rainbow Trout ((Sullivan, 2017)), Bull trout in Alberta ((L. M. MacPherson et al., 2023)), Chinook Salmon in the Nicola Basin ((Pearsall, 2022)) and the Plains Sucker in Southeastern Alberta (L. Jarvis, personal communication, February 23, 2023). On occasion, the term “study system” is used in conjunction with “cumulative effects” to describe a project or development within the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) literature. However, the CEMPRA tool uses specific user-defined valued ecosystem components as the study system. Usually, these are target populations or species, but occasionally they can be interpreted as broader entities with basic applications of CEMPRA where stressors are linked to “aquatic ecosystems”. If broader interpretations describe a study system, care should be taken to ensure that the stressor response functions are still interpretable and biologically relevant. For example, suppose CEMPRA is used for a multi-species assessment. In that case, creating species-specific stressor response curves and running scenarios for each species will likely be necessary.\nStressors: Stressors and stressor-response functions are a core part of the CEMPRA tool. For the purposes of this tool, “stressors” can be defined broadly as “any environmental variable (e.g., temperature, sediment, predation, competition) that can induce a biological response (positive or negative)” ((Rosenfeld et al., 2024); (Jarvis et al., 2023)). Stressors can include any user-defined environmental variable (or driver) that prevents the target species (or ecosystem component) from reaching a fully realized maximum system capacity that would presumably be possible without any harmful impacts. Stressors and stressor-response functions are described further in the next section.\nStressor-Response Function: Stressor-response functions link stressors to the local abundance of the target species or value. The key defining components of stressor-response functions within the CEMPRA tools are that they represent quantitative linkages between raw stressor values and the predicted biological response. Stressor-response functions are equivalent to dose-response curves. They can also be interpreted as habitat suitability curves; however, the default assumption in most cumulative effects assessments is that target locations under evaluation have the capacity to support the study species in the absence of extreme stressor levels. Stressors and stressor-response functions are described further in the next section.\nLocations: The terms “locations”, “study areas”, “spatial units”, “polygons”, and/or “assessment units” are used interchangeably to describe discrete user-defined locations in the study region. Locations are represented in the CEMPRA tool as spatial polygons; linear features like stream reaches can also be represented as narrow polygons. Spatial units can be user-defined based on environmental heterogeneity and an area’s capacity to support the target species. Ideally, location breaks are chosen such that stressor values are largely homogenous within a spatial unit. Location breaks can also be defined to represent known (or suspected) subpopulations if they match management objectives or variations in stressor levels. In most cumulative effects assessments of aquatic ecosystems, location breaks will almost always be generated based on watersheds or subbasin boundaries since these natural geographic breaks often drive differences in key stressor values across the landscape.\nAssessment Endpoints: The ability to effectively link environmental stressors to a focal species using stressor-response functions is a core underlying function of the CEMPRA tool that differentiates it from many other cumulative effects models. Stressor-response functions allow stressor levels in a specific polygon to be used to predict the expected ecological response (system capacity). The CEMPRA tool provides two major workflows and assessment endpoints suitable for data-poor and data-rich systems. Stressor-response functions can be combined with stressor magnitudes in a polygon to predict local habitat capacity based on each stressor level, and the product of predicted habitat capacities for each stressor is used to generate an aggregate cumulative effect of all stressors on adult carrying capacity (the classical single-stage ‘Joe Model’); alternatively, stressors can be run through an integrated life cycle model where stressor-response functions are linked to vital rates (e.g., survivorship, capacity) for discrete life-history stages. The simplified roll-up (‘Joe Model’) is useful for data-limited species, but it also serves as a convenient framework for a rapid first-pass assessment to generate heatmaps of stressor severity. The integrated life cycle model has special utility for more data-rich systems where it’s possible to weight and understand stressors through the lens of a demographic stage-structured population framework. This can be especially important where some stressors will have disproportionate impacts on a specific life-history bottleneck and is appropriate for well-studies species with sufficient data to parameterize a population model.\nScenarios: Scenarios represent unique user-defined management or recovery interventions (or the absence of action in a reference scenario) that aid the comparison of the outcome of different management actions. Scenarios (or scenario profiles) can include a combination of changes in one or more stressors at one or more locations to represent a hypothetical management action (or inaction). Scenarios can be implemented as changes to the stressor values (across locations) and/or changes to the stressor-response relationships, changing the underlying assumption of impact pathways (e.g., for a sensitivity analysis if there is uncertainty in stressor magnitudes or stress-or response functions).\nThe purpose of this user guide is to introduce these concepts in further detail with examples that demonstrate how they can be used to implement cumulative effects assessments in the CEMPRA framework. The following sections include setup instructions, a quick start guide, an overview of data inputs, and example cases. The intent is also to highlight the flexibility of the CEMPRA tool as a a generalizable and easy-to-use cumulative effects modelling framework that is adaptable to many different systems and/or species.\n\n\n\n\nHalpern, B.

    "text": "3.1 Individual Stressor Assessments (univariate)\nWhen setting up a cumulative effects model, it is often essential to visualize the spatial distribution of stressor magnitudes. The CEMPRA visual interface is organized around a centralized map interface (see Section 6), which allows users to flip through stressors individually to produce univariate heatmaps (choropleth maps) of each stressor distribution (see Figure A.3). These summaries are simple yet useful to provide a general overview of the study area, stressors, and associated stressor-response functions. The visual interpretation of univariate stressor summaries is largely qualitative. The intent is to visually identify hotspots and/or determine which stressors are high everywhere or low everywhere based on the input stressor magnitude data for each location and the corresponding predicted habitat capacity.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Example of single (univariate) assessment of stressors and stressor-response relationship for hypothetical stressors A & B with univariate heatmaps of predicted single-stressor habitat capacity (“Response” from 0-100%) generated for the study area."

    "text": "3.2 Joe Model: Simplified Stressor Roll-up Summaries\nThe Joe Model component of the CEMPRA tool leverages the library of stressor-response functions, defined and uploaded by the user, to generate a simplified roll-up summary (cumulative effects score) across multiple stressors. These summaries are simply the product of the scaled response values (from 0 to 1, equivalent to 0-100% of the system carrying capacity for adults) of all stressors for each location (Figure A.4). Different stressors can be selected (or omitted) from this summary depending on data availability or to characterize different potential impact pathways.\nIn the Joe Model, the response component of each stressor-response function (y-axis) is characterized broadly as the ‘Mean System Capacity’ of the target study system. ‘Mean System Capacity’ specifically refers to the adult carrying capacity since the basic Joe model is single-stage and assumes that each stressor-response function is calibrated to the adult system capacity; for example, even though in reality, it is salmonid egg and fry survival that are directly impacted by high Selenium concentrations, the effect of selenium dose will be scaled to the impact on the adult population size in the Selenium stressor-response function. This simplification of stage-structured dynamics into a single life stage is one of the key features of the Joe model that allows application to data-deficient species.\nThe calculated Mean System Capacity (Figure A.4) is also referred to as a “cumulative effect score”. Although it can logically be considered an estimate of adult carrying capacity as described above, it also represents a scoring procedure for multiple stressors. In the Joe Model summaries, the cumulative effect score across stressors is calculated by multiplying the mean system capacity metrics together (Figure A.4). However, the model also offers the option for users to custom-define the scoring algorithm (e.g., so that it is not multiplicative; see Sandbox section), in which case it may no longer represent carrying capacity. The Joe Model does not require the weighting of individual stressors; since each stressor is scaled to a maximum of 1, they are all weighed equally by default. By doing this, the Joe Model avoids long-standing difficulties associated with weighting impacts ((Walters, 1997)). In effect, the weights of stressors are represented by the response value (0-1) associated with any given stressor magnitude (Figure A.4).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Additive effect of multiple stressors in the Joe Model. Figure modified from (MacPherson et al., 2020)\n\n\nThe full implementation of the “Joe Model” extends this basic summary to include stochastic simulations with uncertainty represented in both the raw stressor values for each location and the response function (described further in Section 5). These summaries are useful to represent the risk of cumulative effects or current conditions as a distribution rather than a fixed value."

The embedded life cycle modelling framework consists of a stage-structured matrix model that allows users to link stressor-response functions to vital rates for specific life stages (e.g., egg survivorship, fry capacity etc.), unlike the Joe model, where the impact of stressors across multiple life stages are integrated into a single stressor-response function linked to adult capacity. The life cycle model estimates relative changes to population-level productivity and capacity through simulations. A flexible species profile input dataset is available so that users can change values in the species profile to represent different study systems with different life history stages or demographic parameters (e.g., Athabasca Rainbow Trout, Chinook Salmon, etc.).

    "title": "5  Data Inputs",
    "section": "5.1 Stressor-Response Workbook",
    "text": "5.1 Stressor-Response Workbook\n\n5.1.1 Purpose\nThe stressor-response workbook contains all the stressor-response curves applicable to a target study system (e.g., Athabasca Rainbow Trout). These stressor-response curves are used within the CEMPRA (Joe Model) tool to predict cumulative effects additively given stressor magnitude values (discussed in the next section).\n\n\n5.1.2 Layout\nThe stressor-response workbook is an Excel workbook containing all stressor-response functions to be used in the CEMPRA (Joe Model). The first worksheet contained within this Excel workbook must be titled “Main”. This worksheet is used as a coversheet to describe and organize each of the stressor-response curves. Subsequent worksheets describe each of the stressor-response functions relevant to a particular species, where each stressor-response function has its own worksheet. Note that the spelling of the stressor name must be identical between the “Stressors” column in the “Main” worksheet and the worksheet title (on the bottom tab) for each stressor.\nWork is currently underway to develop an online stressor-response web database (a digital repository of stressor-response functions across species, systems and geographic areas compiled across reference literature). As this database grows, functionality will be expanded to automatically generate a stressor-response workbook of selected stressors using the R-package (CEMPRA). See details in Appendix A.\n\n5.1.2.1 Main Worksheet\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Main worksheet in the Stressor-Response workbook.\n\n\nFigure 5.1 shows the main worksheet in the Stressor-Response workbook.\nThe purpose of the “Main” worksheet is to organize and summarize stressor-response functions within the workbook. The columns within this worksheet are set up as follows. Inputs must be diligently followed in order for the code to work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nStressors\nName of the stressor. This must match the stressor-response worksheet title. It must also match the “Stressor” column in the stressor magnitude workbook. Avoid the use of spaces in stressor names.\n\n\nStressor_cat\nCategory of the stressor. Only relevant if multiple stressors are linked with a defined interaction. If there is no interaction, simply copy the stressor name here.\n\n\nInteraction\nInteraction between stressors. Set to NA or leave blank if there are no interactions. Possible interactions available include “Minimum”. If multiple variables are linked together with “Minimum”, the variable with the lowest mean system capacity in the Joe Model will be used, and the other variables will be omitted from the CEMPRA (Joe Model) calculation. This also helps determine which terms should be linked together by defining groups in the “Linked” column. Use letters A, B, C etc., to define distinct groups. If no special interaction is defined between variables, then set these cells to NA.\n\n\nLinked\nFor Variable Linkages: Use NA if no interaction is defined for the target variable; otherwise, choose letters A, B or C to specify variable groups. For example, if there were four stressor-response curves for December, January, February, and March flows, and they were encoded as three separate variables, users could apply the “Minimum” function to link the lowest system capacity across all four terms but only have one winter flow function in the CEMPRA (Joe Model). In this case, the letter A would be used to group all these terms together.\n\n\nStress_Scale\nStressor Scale can be either “linear” or “log” to specify a linear or logarithmic function, respectively, for interpolation.\n\n\nFunction\nEither “continuous” or “step”. “Continuous” will apply linear interpolation between values, and “step” will adjust mean system capacity values in discrete steps.\n\n\nLife_stages\nWhich life stage should each stressor be linked to?Set all values to “adult” if unspecified. The default assumption in the Joe Model is that stressor-response curves are linked to “adult” system capacity.If you are making use of the integrated life cycle model, then possible life stages include “SE” for eggs and “S0” for hatchling/fry. Both SE and S0 are Age-0 individuals. For subsequent stages, use “stage_1”, “stage_2”, “stage_3” etc. for stage-specific linkages (see Section 6.4 and Section 8 for clarification).If the same stressor is linked to multiple life stages, special terms such as “sub_adult” or “adult” can be used to define linkages to all immature (Age-1+) stage classes and all mature (Age-1+) stage classes, respectively. The term “all” will mean that the stressor response curve is linked to all life stages.If the same environmental variable is linked to different life stages with different stressor-response curves, then it is recommended that the user duplicate stressor values and treat them as distinct environmental variables to avoid confusion (e.g., “Temperature_adult”, “Temperature_parr”).\n\n\nParameters\nOnly relevant for the integrated life cycle model: leave blank for scenarios that only make use of the Joe Model.If the stressor-response function is being linked to a vital rate in the life cycle model, describe how the stressor-response curve is linked to the life stage (which vital rate is affected). This column can be left blank if a user is only interested in running the Joe Model.Possible mechanisms include “capacity”, “survival,” or “fecundity”. Once set, the response component of the stressor-response curve will act as a multiplier to the specified vital rate. For example, if a stressor is linked to “survival” of stage X and the stressor-response curve estimates a scaled response of 0.8 based on the stressor magnitude, then the default baseline survivorship will be multiplied by 0.8 in the simulation (e.g., original survivorship of life stage X: 0.34; adjusted survivorship of life stage X: 0.80.34 = 0.27).• survival: Stressors linked to “survival” modify the default survivorship of a given life stage transition.• capacity: Stressors linked to “capacity” will modify the stage-specific capacity values by a multiplier (0 – 1) based on the stressor-response relationship, regardless of the mechanism used to represent density-dependent constraints on growth (compensation ratios vs location and stage-specific K values, See Section 8). Capacity adjustments will be implemented as the final step in the calculation. Stressor-response functions linked to capacity will only have an effect if the life stage is parameterized with density-dependent constraints (e.g., compensation ratios ≠ 1.0 or Beverton-Holt K values enabled). If a stressor-response function is linked to a life stage, but there are no density-dependent constraints on that life stage in the life cycle profile, then the stressor will not have an effect on the simulation.• fecundity: Stressor-response functions linked to fecundity will adjust the (eps) eggs per spawner (female) using the response value as a multiplier on the default input fecundity. For example, if the default fecundity is 3,000 and a stressor linked to fecundity has an effect of 0.6 (response), then the resulting fecundity (epf) in the life cycle model will be 3,000  0.6 = 1,800. Note that the stressor-response relationships must be linked to a sexually mature life stage for the fecundity multiplier to be meaningful. For example, if a fecundity multiplier is linked to an early life stage (e.g., stage_1), but the target species does not become mature until stage_3, then the stressor will have no observable effect on the population.Response (effect) estimates from the stressor-response curves will always be adjusted to 0 if biological response values are below zero, and adjusted to 100 (1.0) if response values exceed 100% in the stressor-response workbook. This ensures that survivorship remains between 0 and 1.\n\n\nUnits\nOptional: include units as meta data (a friendly reminder). This column is not used in any calculations but is included as metadata and displayed on summary plots in the tool (where available).\n\n\nModel\nSet all values to “Joe Model” if not using the life cycle model.This column is used to define which assessment endpoint the stressor-response curve should be applied to. Possible options include “All”, “Joe Model,” or “Life cycle model”. “All” specifies that the stressor-response curve is generic enough to be used in both the Joe Model and the life cycle model. “Joe Model” specifies that the stressor-response relationship should only be used in the simplified Joe Model roll-up summary. “Life cycle model” specifies that the stressor-response relationship is only applicable to the life cycle model.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Individual Stressor-Response Curve Worksheets\nThe remaining worksheets in the Stressor-response workbook are all used to describe the relationships between raw stressor values (on the x-axis) and the biological response (on the y-axis) (i.e., the stressor-response data).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Example of an individual stressor worksheet within the stressor response Excel workbook.\n\n\n\nExample of an individual stressor worksheet within the stressor response Excel workbook.\n\nIndividual stressor worksheets within the stressor-response file contain stressor-response curves for each of the stressor-response functions outlined in the “Main” worksheet (one worksheet for each row). The spelling of the worksheet name must exactly match the spelling of the stressor on the ‘Main’ worksheet. Additional rows can be added (as needed) to increase the resolution and specify the shape of a complex non-linear stressor response curve. Threshold stressor-response functions or stressor-response functions with discrete values may have relatively few rows.\nThe columns within each stressor-response worksheet are formatted as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n[Stressor]\nThe raw value of the stressor (on the x-axis). For example, the temperature would likely be valued in degrees Celsius, but the units and additional metadata are declared on the ‘Main’ worksheet.\n\n\nMean System Capacity (%)\nThe Mean System Capacity (on the y-axis) is associated with the raw stressor value on the x-axis. This column is the response component of the stressor-response curve. Values should be entered as a percentage and range from 0 to 100. Note that, for the life cycle model, this value may be the life-stage-specific dose-response curve for capacity or survival. Mean system capacity is user as a generic term across the Joe Model and Life Cycle Model.\n\n\nSD\nStandard Deviation (SD) is used to resample the mean system capacity (response) values based on a given stressor level. In the CEMPRA (Joe Model) simulations, environmental parameters are resampled for each batch replicate, year and location based on SD values in the stressor magnitude workbook. This column is used to represent uncertainty in the stressor-response relationship. Resampling will be based on the mean system capacity and SD values with a normal distribution (linear) or log scale (log) according to the value specified in the main worksheet under the Stress_Scale column.Regardless of the parameters for resampling, the lower limit and upper limit values will constrain values to fixed limits.If the SD value is set to zero, then no resampling will take place within the stressor-response curve.\n\n\nlow.limit\nThe lower limit for stressor-response resampling (see SD column distribution). Set to 0 as a default.\n\n\nup.limit\nThe upper limit for stressor-response resampling (see SD column distribution). Set to 100 as a default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 How to Build Your Own Stressor-Response Function\nCEMPRA (Joe Model) users can either select pre-assembled stressor-response functions or define their own stressor-response functions for use in the model. A library is currently being developed to host pre-assembled stressor-response functions and their associated documentation (Appendix A). Users who develop their own stressor-response functions are encouraged to fill out the appropriate documentation for their function and upload it to this public stressor-response library for future use (Appendix A). Please see (MacPherson et al., 2020) and (Rosenfeld et al., 2022) for further discussion on fundamental considerations in the development of customized stressor-response functions.\n\n5.1.3.1 Methodology\nDepending on data availability, stressor-response functions may be developed from available empirical data, from the elicitation of experts and stakeholders, or from existing literature.\nWhen using empirical data, the response component of the stressor-response relationship must be standardized to a common response metric. For convenience, the CEMPRA tool uses Mean System Capacity as a generic nickname to represent a standardized response scaled from 0% to 100%. In the CEMPRA tool (both the Joe Model and Life Cycle Model assessment endpoints), stressor-response relationships are reported as a scaled response value from 0% to 100%. These values are reported in the stressor-response workbook. The default assumption is that when a stressor is at its lowest level (or least harmful state if the scale is reversed), the mean system capacity will be set to 100% for that stressor. If this adjustment is not made, scenarios will be ranked differently simply by including specific stressors for comparison regardless of ecological state."

    "section": "5.2 Stressor Magnitude File",
    "text": "5.2 Stressor Magnitude File\n\n5.2.1 Purpose\nThe stressor magnitude file is an Excel worksheet which defines and bounds each stressor within the individual locations (i.e., spatial units) being assessed. Similar to the stressor-response functions, stressor magnitude values are sampled across locations with stochasticity. The stressor magnitude workbook is structured accordingly, with data for each stressor and location entered into the dataset in a long table format (as opposed to the standard wide table format). Each row specifies a unique stressor for each unique location. Therefore, the number of rows in this dataset should be equal to the number of stressors multiplied by the number of locations. For each simulation in the CEMPRA tool, values are sampled at random with stochasticity for each stressor and location. For each year and batch replicate, stressor magnitude values will be drawn from each normal (or lognormal) distribution based on the Mean and SD (standard deviation) and then further constrained based on the specified lower and upper limits.\nIf there is no suspected uncertainty or interannual variability in stressor magnitude values for a given stressor and/or location, then the SD value can be set to 0, and the lower limit, upper limit and distribution type can be ignored.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Example of a stressor magnitude workbook.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Layout\nEach row in the stressor magnitude workbook specifies a relationship between a unique stressor and a unique location. Locations (discussed in detail in the next section) are specified by a unique ID (HUC_ID) and NAME. The HUC_ID column is a legacy from an older version of the Joe Model that referenced Hydrological Unit Codes as ID values, but HUC_ID can be any set of unique IDs specified by the user for their spatial units of interest. The NAME column can be blank but is included for convenience since many users find it challenging to cross-reference ID values between different datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHUC_ID\nAn ID field is used to represent a unique location (spatial unit). The HUC_ID column is a legacy from an older version of the Joe Model that referenced Hydrological Unit Codes as ID values, but HUC_ID can be any set of unique IDs specified by the user for their spatial units of interest. The NAME column can be blank but is included for convenience since many users find it challenging to cross-reference ID values between different datasets.The HUC_ID field must match the feature column HUC_ID in the spatial polygons file.\n\n\nNAME\nThe NAME of the polygon in the spatial polygons file. This field must match the NAME column in the spatial polygons file, but it can be blank if a spatial unit does not have a defining name.\n\n\nStressor\nStressor Name. This must match the information and sheet names in the stressor-response workbook.\n\n\nStressor_cat\nName of the Stressor category. This column must match the spelling used in the stressor-response workbook.\n\n\nMean\nThe mean value of the stressor for the spatial unit (location) HUC_ID (polygon).\n\n\nSD\nStandard deviation (SD) of stressor values for the target HUC_ID. During the simulation, stressor values for each HUC_ID are resampled from a distribution with mean and SD values. Setting the SD to zero means that there will be no variability in the stressor value during the simulation.\n\n\nDistribution\nType of distribution to use for resampling. Either “normal” or “lognormal”. We recommend using a “normal” distribution where possible. Testing coverage is incomplete for “lognormal”.\n\n\nLow_Limit\nThe lower limit for resampling.\n\n\nUp_Limit\nThe upper limit for resampling.\n\n\nComments\nInternal comments by the user for personal reference. It can be blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Assembling Your Own Stressor-Magnitude Data\nData for stressor magnitude estimates can come from a variety of sources, including GIS data, modelled data, field data, expert opinion, regional trends, or estimates from the literature. When assembling your own stressor magnitude data, stressor magnitudes and ranges will need to be assigned to the individual locations (spatial units) being represented in the model. Stressors within each location must be assigned a magnitude, and distribution or the SD value must be set to 0 for simulations with no stochasticity. Within each spatial unit, users can specify the mean value, standard deviation, distribution (normal or lognormal), and upper and lower limits of each stressor, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Example of assigning stressor magnitudes values (stream temperature) to spatial units (locations).\n\n\nStressor magnitude values should be aggregated to locations to represent location-averaged estimates. Locations can be split and aggregated as needed such that each location represents averaged generalized conditions."

Locations should be defined to reflect heterogeneity in stressor values across the study area.\nSpatial polygons are imported into the CEMPRA tool as a GIS data file. Possible formats include either geopackage (.gpkg) or shapefile (.shp) format. The spatial units GIS data file does not contain any stressor magnitude data for modelling but consists of just the geometry and fields for the location ID (HUC_ID) and NAME. The polygon geometry included in this file is used for display purposes only and is joined to the stressor magnitude file when imported into the CEMPRA. Therefore, the size and shape of each spatial unit do not influence any components of the assessment.\nRegardless of the file format, the GIS (locations) spatial polygon data file must meet the following criteria:\n\n“HUC_ID” field: The locations data layer must have an attributed field labelled ‘HUC_ID’ with a unique identifier for each spatial unit (location).\n“NAME” field: The locations data layer must have an attributed field labelled ‘NAME’. This field is included for convenience. Values in this field can be blank, but users are encouraged to populate this field.\nThe HUC_ID and NAME fields must match values (and spelling) in the stressor magnitude Excel input so data can be cross-referenced and joined in the tool.\nThe spatial polygons file must be imported in the standard latitude/longitude projection (CRS: “EPSG:4326 – WGS84”). External GIS software such as QGIS can be used to transform projections as needed.\nThere should be no geometry errors (invalid geometries) in the polygon geometry data. Run check geometry and fix errors in programs such as QGIS.\nSimplify geometries: we recommended running functions like ‘Simplify geometries’ in programs such as QGIS to reduce the file size before importing data into the CEMPRA tool. Ideally, the locations spatial polygon data file should be under 10MB for the best performance in the Shiny application. Processing larger datasets is possible by using the R package version of the CEMPRA tool.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Example of a spatial polygons (locations) file and its associated attribute table with fields HUC_ID and NAME."

    "text": "6.3 Map Overview\n\n6.3.1 Map Window\nThe map window on the Map Overview page allows users to view stressor magnitudes and model results in a choropleth map based on the spatial polygons layer you imported. The map in the centre of the screen is interactive and allows users to scroll, zoom, and select individual polygons. When hovering over a polygon, users will see the name and HUC_ID of that polygon displayed directly above the map window. To select a polygon, click on it once. Selected polygons will appear in blue. Clicking on additional polygons will add to your selection. To deselect a polygon, click it again. The number of selected polygons (HUCs) will appear below the map window on the left-hand side. Click the “deselect all” button beside this text string to deselect all polygons.\n\n\n6.3.2 Stressors\nOn the Map Overview page, users can view stressor-response relationships for each of the stressors included in the input stressor-response Excel workbook. A list of these stressors is on the screen’s right side. Clicking on the chart icon next to one of the stressors opens a pop-up window to view the stressor-response curve and raw stressor-response table associated with that specific stressor. You can edit cell values within the stressor-response table by double-clicking on the cell you want to edit. Any edits to the stressor-response table will automatically appear in the stressor-response curve.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Stressor-response relationship pop-up window example. 1) Description of table and stressor-response curve. 2) Stressor-response curve plot. 3) Stressor-response curve input table. 4) List of stressors used in the CEMPRA (Joe Model).\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Joe Model\nTo run the Joe Model, click the “Joe Model” button in the centre of the lower panel. In the pop-up window, you can select/deselect variables that you want to include/exclude in the Joe Model run. In addition, you can specify the number of simulations or batch runs you would like to conduct (in the “Number of Simulations” box), and you can provide a name for the simulation (in the “Name of this Simulation” box). When you are ready to run the Joe Model for all spatial polygons in the study area, click “Run the Joe Model”. Note there is currently no option to run the Joe Model for individual spatial polygons.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Pop-up window for the Joe Model. 1) Variables to include/exclude from cumulative effects modelling. 2) Inputs for the number of simulations and the name of the simulation. 3) Button to run the Joe Model. 4) Button to bring up the pop-up window.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 System Capacity Plots\nAfter running the Joe Model, a new section labelled “System Capacity Plots” will appear at the bottom of the map page. You can view tables and plots of the cumulative system capacity for selected watersheds (click “Selected watersheds”) or for all watersheds (click “All watersheds”) compared to the global mean system capacity across all simulations.\nSystem capacity plots show the scaled probability output from the Joe Model from stochastic simulations.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: System capacity plots for eleven spatial units (locations) showing the cumulative system capacity scores (mean, median and scaled probability distributions).\n\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Adjust Magnitude\nUsers may wish to modify stressor values to represent recovery action or habitat loss. To view and edit stressor magnitudes for an individual spatial polygon, select the spatial polygon of interest and click “Adjust Magnitude” on the right-hand side of the lower panel. Next, review the mean system capacity in the pop-up window for one or more selected locations. Below this, a table containing all the stressors, their magnitudes and distributions will be displayed. Double-click on the desired cell to edit any of the values in this table. Adjust the mean value for each stressor (Mean), the standard deviation (SD), the distribution type (options are normal or lognormal), and the lower limit and upper limit (for stochastic simulations). Note that stressor names and system capacity values cannot be edited. If only one HUC is selected, values will appear in the table; however, if multiple HUCs are selected, the table will appear blank. When multiple HUCs are selected, all modified values will be shared across the selected HUCs. The mean system capacity is shown for selected HUCs to preview the model output.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Example of single or multi-location stressor magnitude adjustment across spatial units.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.6 Life Cycle Model\nTo run the life cycle model associated with the CEMPRA, first select (click) the desired spatial polygons for the run. Once the desired spatial polygons are selected, click the “Life cycle model” button on the left side of the lower panel. In the pop-up window that appears, enter the number of years (in the “N-years” box) and the number of replicates or batch runs (in the “N-replicates” box). When ready to run the life cycle model for the selected spatial polygons, click “Run Life cycle model”.\nAfter the run is complete, three graph panels will appear in the pop-up window. The first panel displays time series projections of the number of individuals by life stage and a time series of lambda values for adults. The second-panel plots abundance at different life stages in the selected spatial polygon(s) compared to a baseline condition. The third-panel plots stressor magnitude against system capacity (0-1) for each of the stressors used in the model. You can view individual data points by hovering over the plot with your cursor. When hovering over the plot, you will also see a menu appear in the top right-hand corner of the plotting window. This menu allows you to pan and zoom around the plot and download a snapshot of the plot onto your computer.\n ## Life Cycle Model\nThe life cycle model is included as an extension to the original CEMPRA. It leverages a flexible stage-structured life cycle modeling framework that can be modified for different target systems. The underlying life cycle model code was originally developed by van der Lee and Koops (2020) and then further modified by Dr. Kyle Wilson to incorporate environmental stressors that are linked to survivorship, capacity, and growth.\nIf you intend to use the coupled life cycle model along with the Joe Model, click on the Life cycle model page in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen. This page will display all of the parameters and vital rates being used as inputs for the life cycle model. To edit any of these parameters, click anywhere inside the box for a given parameter and either manually enter a new number, or use the up and down arrows that appear on the right side of the box to incrementally adjust the value. Refer to Section 7 for background and additional details on the life cycle modeling component of the CEMPRA tool.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Life cycle model page of the R Shiny application. 1) Input section for population vital rates. 2) Parameters for density-independent and density-dependent components of the model. 3) Sandbox for conducting sample runs of the life cycle model.\n\n\nMatrix elements and derived parameters from the life cycle model are shown in the upper right corner of the page. These values will update in real-time as users change the inputs. Lambda values are useful because they show if population parameters will cause the population to grow (lambda greater than 1) or shrink over time (lambda less than 1). Generation time can also be useful to reference against the target population of interest.\nClicking on the “Eigen Analysis” button will bring up a full modal display showing the derived transition matrix, elasticities, sensitivities, net reproductive rates, and stable stage distributions.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Full eigen analysis showing the transition matrix, sensitivity matrix, elasticity matrix, stable stage distribution estimate of the intrinsic population growth rate (lambda), generation time, and damping ratio.\n\n\nThe symbolic representation of the transition matrix can also be reviewed by clicking on the “Symbolic Representations” button. Additional explainer popups are also available throughout the page.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Symbolic (equation) representation of the transition matrix and density dependence matrix.\n\n\nIn the bottom left-hand corner of the page is a population projection “sandbox” module. This section allows the user to run sample projections of the population forward through time over a set number of years and batch replicates. Adjusting any of the life cycle parameters and re-running the sandbox projection will allow the user to see how their changes influence the growth trajectory and variability of the population. Running simulations is valuable since it allows users to capture density-dependent and density-independent components of the life cycle model. Separate time series are drawn for the current (red) and previous (teal) projections. The mean value (across batch replicates) is shown as a line, and the grey shading shows the variability across each batch replicate (Figure 6.10).\nThe sandbox module can also be used to run sample projections for hypothetical combinations of stressor values. Stressor variables linked to the life cycle model and uploaded by the user will appear below the “Demo Projection Time Series” button. Users can populate these values to demonstrate how an individual stressor (or group of stressors) will influence the population at a set of hypothetical values. Be sure to expand the panel for each stressor and values for the mean, SD, lower limit, and upper limit. Check or uncheck the checkbox to include or exclude the stressor in the sandbox simulations.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Population projection “sandbox” showing stage-specific abundance values for current and previous model runs. Users may change values such as fecundity or a stressor to visualize how the population will respond to hypothetical changes to parameters (outside of formalized scenario runs)."

    "text": "7.1 Overview\nThe integrated life cycle model is a core component of the CEMPRA tool. The life cycle modeling component is a valuable endpoint to evaluate and understand cumulative effects through the lens of demographic rates and population ecology. Some user groups may be satisfied with the simplified Joe Modelling (stressor roll-up) component of the CEMPRA tool and, therefore, not wish to interact with the life cycle model. However, other user groups may benefit substantially from working with the life cycle modeling component. Framing cumulative effects through an integrated life cycle model allows us to understand critical bottlenecks to the productivity and capacity of a target study system. In the CEMPRA life cycle modeling component, stressor-response relationships are linked to vital rates such as life-stage-specific survivorship, fecundity, and carrying capacity. Therefore, the life cycle modeling component can be used to make relative comparisons between locations (spatial units), scenarios, and stressors to understand limiting factors and design recovery action strategies.\nAt its core, the life cycle modeling component of the CEMPRA tool is a stage-structured matrix model (see (Caswell, 1997)). A simplified life cycle profile csv data input file (described below) is populated by the user and then imported to parameterize and construct components of the matrix model (e.g., number of stages, stage-specific survivorship, years in each stage, etc.).\nWhen the life cycle model is run, a hypothetical population is projected forward in time through simulations. The stage-structured matrix model governs the behavior of the simulated population. Density-dependent growth constraints are implemented using either compensation ratios (if the location and stage-specific capacities are unknown) or location and stage-specific Beverton-Holt functions (discussed further below). Location-specific stressor values will interact with the simulated population to curtail or enhance stage-specific survivorship, fecundity, or habitat capacities. Population projections are then compared across scenarios and/or locations to evaluate the relative change in equilibrium abundance estimates for a target life stage (i.e., carrying capacities) and/or the intrinsic productivity (i.e., growth rates) possible at low densities.\nThe life cycle modeling component of the CEMPRA tool performs a large number of calculations behind the scenes. While convenient, the embedded complexity can create misleading results if input values and assumptions are not carefully considered. It is assumed that users of the life cycle model have an understanding of basic concepts in population ecology (e.g., population growth rates, carrying capacities etc.) and a familiarity with matrix life cycle models. The following resources provide useful refreshers for interested individuals:\n\nBasic refresher on matrix life cycle models: https://compadre-db.org/Education/article/what-is-a-matrix-model\nAn in-depth overview of stage-structured matrix models: https://blog.uvm.edu/tdonovan-vtcfwru/files/2020/06/12-Donov-pages-322-CB.pdf\nDensity-dependent and density-independent constraints on population growth: https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/population-limiting-factors-17059572/\nDensity-dependent growth functions (review section on the Beverton-Holt function): http://courses.ecology.uga.edu/ecol4000-fall2018/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2018/08/Chapter-3-complex-dynamics.pdf\n\nThe model code for the life cycle modeling component of the CEMPRA tool follows a similar structure to the code base used by (Van der Lee & Koops, 2020). The underlying code and assessment framework was modified substantially by Dr. Kyle Wilson and Matthew Bayly (M.J. Bayly Analytics Ltd.) throughout 2022 and 2024.

    "text": "7.2 Data Input: Life Cycle Profiles\n\n7.2.1 Purpose\nThe life cycle profile is the main input file for the life cycle model. It provides the names and values of key life cycle parameters and vital rates, including parameters for survival, growth, reproduction, and density-dependent effects. This file makes it easy for users to store and edit life cycle parameter values either within or outside of the R Shiny web application. The following sections break down the components of the life cycle profile file with illustrative examples. The intent of the following sections is to provide a detailed explanation of how the life cycle model works with a description of each component of the input file so that users may create their own life cycle profile for a target species of interest.\n\n\n7.2.2 Layout\nThe life cycle profile is a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains the names and values of each of the parameters within the life cycle model. Life cycle profiles will be unique to each species or life history variant. The life cycle profile file contains three columns:\n\nParameters: The full name/description of the parameter. This column can be adjusted by the user to provide more relevant nicknames for each stage (e.g., fry survival, smolt survival etc.). Please update and change these values for your study system.\nName: The short form name of the parameter used in the model. The names of these parameters are referenced by the model code and should not be modified (apart from adding or removing stage classes). Feel free to add or remove rows, depending on the number of stages, but do not change the text in this column.\nValue: The numeric value of the parameter used in the model.

    "section": "7.3 Matrix Life Cycle Model",
    "text": "7.3 Matrix Life Cycle Model\nThe stage-structured matrix modelling framework, embedded within the CEMPRA tool, can be represented graphically by a life cycle diagram (figure) or a transition matrix. The transition matrix can be represented symbolically with either equations (Table 1) or absolute values (Table 2). The structure of the life cycle diagram and transition matrix will be different depending on whether the anadromous input is set to TRUE (for anadromous life histories e.g., salmon) or FALSE (for non-anadromous life histories e.g., most trout).\nThe life cycle diagram figure (below) shows stage class transitions for Athabasca Rainbow Trout. In the diagram and input file, we see that there are four main stages (stage_1 to stage_4). stage_1 individuals can become stage_4 individuals after three years in the simulation, but it is also possible for some individuals to spend more than one year in stages 2, 3, and 4 (denoted by the circular loop). We also see that stage_4 individuals are sexually mature and have the capacity to generate new stage_1 individuals. There are also special year 0 (Age-0) events that occur before new stage_1 (Age-1) individuals are secured in the simulation. These events include egg survival (SE) and Age-0 fry survival (S0).\n\n\n\nSamle life cycle diagram for Athabasca Rainbow Trout.\n\n\nThe life cycle modelling component of the CEMPRA tool is set up as a pre-birth pulse census (see Caswell 2000). Since the design of stage-structured matrix models does not easily allow for the initial number of eggs and fry to be represented as independent matrix elements (cells), their transitions are included within the fecundity term. In a pre-birth pulse census, we assume that the demographic census takes place immediately before spawning (fecundity), meaning that yearlings of the previous spawning year have survived a full time-step (Age-0/stage-0 to Age-1/stage-1). Yearlings (Age-0: egg & fry) must survive the entire census period to the start of the next census. Therefore, the Age-0 transitions (egg-to-fry survivorship: SE and fry-to-parr survivorship: S0) are accounted for within the fecundity element (cells) of the transition matrix (Table 1).\n\n7.3.1 Anadromous Life Histories\n\nParameter in the life cycle parameters file to trigger the anadromous life history. To use the anadromous life history schedule you must add a row with the parameter name anadromous and then set the value to TRUE. If the anadromous parameter is not specified or missing/excluded from the life cycle parameters inputs file the CEMPRA toolbox will assume that the population is not anadromous.\n\n\nParameter\nName\nValue\n\n\n\n\nAnadromous\nanadromous\nTRUE\n\n\n\nFor semelparous species (such as salmon) we need to impose a slightly different structure to accurately represent a terminal spawner class (B) with death upon reproduction. This can become challenging because we need to also account for the fact that some species such as Coho Salmon, Chinook Salmon, Steelhead etc. will choose to return to spawn at different ages. For example, some Chinook Salmon will return to spawn at age-3, age-4, or age-5 (and sometimes even later). Therefore, the matrix structure needs to represent a dual track for breeders (B) that return to spawn and pre-breeders (P) that remain at sea (or elsewhere) for continued growth. Elegant solutions have been proposed by (Davison & Satterthwaite, 2016) (and others) to achieve this.\nThe diagram below illustrates the anadromous life history diagram for Chinook Salmon. In this diagram, there are two pathways available to individual age-2 fish transitioning to age-3 fish. Individuals may return for spawning as breeders (B) (orange boxes) or remain in the marine environment as pre-breeders (Pb) (light blue boxes) for additional years. Pre-breeder (Pb) age classes can have interannual survivorship estimates &gt;0 (to advance fish to older cage classes) but all spawner classes (B-breeders) will die after spawning. The probability of becoming a spawner (at age 3-5) will depend on the portion that become mature at each age class (mat_x). For example, the transition from age-2 (Pb - prebreeders) to age-3 spawners (B - breeders) will be expressed as the baseline marine survivorship from age-2 to age-3  (surv_2) multiplied by the portion of fish that spawn at age-3 (mat_3). Additional migratory mortality for age-3 fish returning to spawn can expressed as (smig_3). Alternatively, age-2 fish can remain at sea for another year to enter the age-3 pre-breeder marine class (stage_Pb_3). This marine transition (stage_Pb_2 to stage_Pb_3) will be expressed as the baseline age-2 to age-3 marine survivorship (surv_2) * the portion of fish that do not spawn at age-3 (1 – mat_3). The cycle repeats itself until the final transition from age-4 to age-5. We assume that age-5 is the maximum possible age any fish can achieve. mat_5 is set 1.0 (100% of remaining individuals return to spawn). No fish will enter into the class (stage_Pb_5 – not shown). We can also set surv_5 to 0, but doing so is not necessary if mat_5 is set to 1.0.\nRecruitment of one-year-old fish (stage_Pb_1) is a function of the number of spawners of a given age class (e.g., stage_B_x) multiplied by the average pre-spawn mortality of that age class (u_x), the average fecundity (eggs per female spawner, eps) for that age class (eps_x), the sex ratio (portion female, SR), the average egg survivorship (SE), and finally the average fry survivorship (S0). We can assume the spawning events (events) and interval (int) are both set to 1.0. Therefore, the number of stage_Pb_1 recruits from age-3 spawners would be expressed as (μ_3 * events * eps_3 * SE * s0 * SR)/int.\nThis diagram can be restructured for Coho, Steelhead, Coastal Cutthroat etc. by adjusting vital rates and then adding or removing age class maturity schedules (see examples at the end of this chapter). We strongly recommend that all implimentations of the CEMPRA anadromous life cycle model for salmon develop an age-based matrix model (Leslie Matrix Models) as a opposed to a stage-based matrix model. We have found that these are less prone to misinterpretations and easier to diagnose.\n\n\n\nGeneralized life history stage class transition diagram for anadromous species (example for Chinook Salmon)\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Vital Rates for Survivorship and Growth\nThe CEMPRA tool’s “pre-birth pulse” census assumes that the demographic census occurs just before spawning. This means that individuals counted as yearlings (from the previous spawning season) have already survived one full time-step—from birth (Age-0/Stage-0) to Age-1/Stage-1.\nDuring the first year, two survival rates apply:\nSE: Egg survivorship. S0: Sub-yearling (fry) survivorship. Their product (SE × S0) represents the overall early-life survival (surv_0, although it isn’t explicitly modeled).\nOnce individuals reach Age 1 (Stage 1), the parameter surv_1 governs the density-independent transition to Stage 2. For most anadromous species, which migrate to sea shortly after spawning, surv_1 should be calculated as the product of smolt survivorship and the survival rate during the first several months at sea (up to the individual’s second birthday). For species/life histories that reside in the freshwater environment for longer (e.g., Coho & stream-type Chinook), surv_1 can be adjusted to represent yearling/parr survivorship.\nThe following table lists the vital rates for survivorship and growth:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNstage\nThe number of stages in the transition matrix (excluding Stage-0/Age-0).\nFor non-anadromous species: Each stage must span one or more years in the life cycle. In the reference example, there are four stages: stage_1, stage_2, stage_3, and stage_4.\nFor anadromous species we must assume each year is one stage. In the previous example with Chinook salmon the max age is 5, so there are 5 stages. Do not double-count spawning and non-spawning sub-classes.\n\n\nsurv_1\nsurv_2\nsurv_3\nsurv_…\nMean annual survivorship of individuals in for each stage transition (e.g., surv_1 is the survival of transitioning from stage 1 to stage 2; surv_2 is the survival from stage 2 to stage 3.\nCreate new rows in the life cycle parameter csv file so that surv_1, surv_2, surv_3, etc. extends to the Nstage.\nSimilarily delete rows if Nstage is lower that the default csv file. These survivorship estimates should be estimates of intrinsic density-independent survival (in the absence of density-dependent constraints).\n\n\nyear_1\nyear_2\nyear_3\nyear_…\nThe number of years spent in each stage (e.g., year_2 is the number of years spent in stage class 2). Usually these values will all be 1 (one stage = one year). However, individuals in the simulation can spend more than one year in each stage. In the example input file, mature adults can spend up to five years in stage_4. If we were to set the year values to 1 for all stages, then we would have an age-based Leslie matrix model. If additional stages are added (or removed), be sure to modify rows in the life cycle profile CSV file accordingly (i.e., delete or add new rows to match Nstage).\n\n\nSE\nEgg survivorship (density-independent).\n\n\nS0\nAge-0 fry or sub-yearling survivorship (density-independent).\n\n\n\nTable: Vital rates for survivorship and growth in the life cycle model.\nEnsure that all survivorship estimates represent hypothetical density-independent survivorship in the absence of density-dependent constraints. Density-dependent survivorship is accounted for in the next section. If density-independent survivorship is unknown, but strong, density-dependent constraints are to be included in the species profile, then it might be possible to simply set the density-independent survivorship estimate to a value close to 1.0 (e.g., S0: 0.999).\nFor fecundity, we have to consider the proportion of each age class that is sexually mature (mat), the proportion of the population that is female (SR: 0.5), the fecundity (eps: eggs per spawner) per spawning event, the spawning events per year (events), and the spawning interval (int). The calculation of individuals in stage class 1 (stage_1) also must account for the Age-0 survivorship of eggs and fry.\nSample fecundity function for stage class 4:\n\n\n\nSample fecundity function for non-anadromous simulations\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Vital Rates for Fecundity\nThe following table lists the vital rates for fecundity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmat_1\nmat_2\nmat_3\nmat_…\n(1 to Nstage)\nThe proportion of each stage class that is sexually mature (0 – 1). For example, in the demo species profile, 100% of the individuals become sexually mature at stage class 4, and the sexual maturity is 0% for all other stage classes. It is also possible for a stage class to have partial maturity (e.g., 0.85). If the Nstage value is different than four, then add or remove rows in the species profile so that the number of mat values matches the number of stage classes (Nstage value).\nAnadromous simulations: For some anadromous species such as Chinook salmon, individuals will generally return to spawn between age-3 and age-6. Different populations will have different maturity schedules (e.g., 15% age-3, 70% age-4, 100% age-5 etc.). These values do not need to sum to 100% but age-specific maturity is simply the probability that an individual will become sexually mature and return to spawn at a given age. For anadromous species the oldest age class should have a maturity of 100%, meaning that 100% of individuals at that age class will be ready to spawn.\n\n\nevents\nSpawning events per female per year. This parameter will almost always be set to 1 for most species to indicate one spawning event per year per mature female. Even for populations with complex life history variants (e.g., systems with both Spring Chinook & Fall Chinook), we still recommend keeping this value at one and using two different species profiles to represent each life history variant.\n\n\nFixed Fecundity:\neps\nStage-specific Fecundity (anadromous):\neps_3\nesp_4\neps_5\neps_…\nEggs per spawning female (eps). The mean fecundity per female per spawning event.\nAnadromous simulations: For most species we can simply enter an estimate of the mean eggs per female spawner as a fixed global value (e.g., 500 eggs/spawner). However, for some species we may wish to enter in a separate fecundity value for each stage/age class (e.g., Age-3 spawners, eps_3: 3,700; Age-4 spawners, 4,200 eggs/spawner; Age-5 spawners, 5,000 eggs/spawner).\nIf you choose to enter in age/stage-specific fecundity estimates please delete the row for ‘eps’. If you choose to enter in a fixed global fecundity then delete the age-specific fecundity estimates. Currently age-specific fecundities only works for anadromous simulations.\n\n\nSR\nThe sex ratio is represented as the proportion of the population that is female. This value will almost always be set to 0.5 to indicate an equal proportion of males and females in the population.\n\n\nint\nSpawning interval (in years). This value will also be set to 1 for most species, indicating that mature individuals spawn each year. Proceed with caution if you choose to use a value other than 1 for this input (see details in formulas).\n\n\nsmig_3\nsmig_4\nsmig_5\n…\n(Spawner migration Survivorship Rates: Anadromous simulations only)\nSpawner migration survivorship rates for each age class. For example, smig_4 is migratory survivorship for age-4 spawners. These parameters act as a survivorship multiplier. If the spawner migration mortality is 10% then smig_4 should be input as 0.9 (1 - 0.1). These values can be set to 1.0 for initial model setup. Similar to other input parameters check the Nstage value and add or remove rows so that smig_3, smig_4, smig_5 entries are present for each of the mature age classes (anywhere where mat_x is set and is greater than zero).\n\n\nu_3\nu_4\nu_5\nu_…\n(Prespawn Survivorship Rates: Anadromous simulations only)\nPrespawn survivorship rates for each age class. For example u_4 is pre-spawn survivorship for age-4 spawners. These parameters act as a survivorship multiplier. If the prespawn mortality is 10% then u_4 (prespawn survivorship) should be input as 0.9 (1 - 0.1). These values can be set to 1.0 for initial model setup. Similar to other input parameters check the Nstage value and add or remove rows so that u_3, u_4, u_5 entries are present for each of the mature age classes (anywhere where mat_x is set and is greater than zero).\n\n\n\nTable: Vital rates for fecundity in the life cycle model."

    "section": "7.5 Density-Dependent Constraints on Growth",
    "text": "7.5 Density-Dependent Constraints on Growth\nIt is rare for natural populations to grow in perpetuity without any constraints on growth, survival, and reproduction. Therefore, life cycle models will typically include a mechanism (or multiple mechanisms) to constrain population growth or limit high densities.\nStressor-response relationships can be incorporated into the life cycle model without accounting for density-dependent constraints, but the interpretation of the results will be limited to eigen analyses of intrinsic growth rates and sensitivities/elasticities assessments. Not only are these outputs difficult to communicate to diverse working groups, but they may also be misleading. If there are key demographic bottlenecks in the life cycle, then a density-independent model may inappropriately lead users to focus on stressors linked to fecundity or early life-stage survivorship before a key bottleneck (e.g., egg-to-fry survivorship) is experienced. However, if (in reality) a hypothetical population experiences strong density-dependent constraints on growth, then factors limiting habitat availability or productivity of a key life stage will become more influential. A common example of density-independent and density-dependent constraints on growth can be found in the transition between the early life stages of Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as individuals transition from egg-to-fry (a density-independent life stage) and then from fry-to-smolts/parr (a density-dependent life stage) (Ward & Slaney, 1993).\nThe life cycle modeling component of the CEMPRA tool has two different mechanisms to incorporate density-dependent growth constraints. The first mechanism makes use of adult carrying capacity and compensation ratios (discussed below), while the second mechanism considers stage and location-specific carrying capacities. Incorporating density-dependent constraints with compensation ratios is convenient because users can evaluate projections in the population model without specifying location-specific habitat availability estimates. However, in most cases incorporating density-dependent constraints with stage and location-specific carrying capacities can provide more tailored results in systems with ample habitat data and knowledge of life stage-specific density constraints across habitat types.\nBoth mechanisms of density-dependent constraints utilize the Beverton-Holt function to constrain the transition probability of key demographic bottlenecks. The Beverton-Holt function calculates the expected number of individuals in the next time step (N at time + 1, or density) as a function of the number of individuals in the current time step (N at time). In the case of stage-structured matrix models, this relationship is expressed as the number of individuals transitioning between two stages (e.g., from stage 2 to stage 3). In the Beverton-Holt function, input parameters governing this relationship include an estimate of stage-specific carrying capacity (K), a baseline estimate of density-independent survival (S) (surv_X from the species profile) for the transition probability, and the number of individuals in the current stage class (Nt) for the simulation year.\n\n\n\nBeverton-Holt function for density-dependent growth\n\n\nThe following figure provides an overview of the Beverton-Holt function, showing the number of individuals at time (t) on the x-axis and the number of individuals at time + 1 on the y-axis. For example, this could be the number of Age-0 fry on the x-axis and the number of Age-1+ parr recruits on the y-axis. The curved black line shows the effects of density-dependent growth (limited recruitment as the number of individuals in the first stage is increased). The steep red line is the intrinsic productivity (survivorship, surv_X), which is 0.8 under hypothetical density-independent growth conditions. The blue line is the hypothetical carrying capacity of 100.\n\n\n\nBeverton-Holt function for density-dependent growth\n\n\n\nBeverton-Holt function for density-dependent growth shows the survivorship under density-independent growth (red line), the maximum carrying capacity (blue line), and the resulting relationship from the BH curve (black line).\n\n\n7.5.1 Location and Stage-Specific Carrying Capacities\nFor more systems with ample habitat data and known relationships between habitat availability and maximum densities, it is possible to use location-specific carrying capacities for one or more rate-limiting life stages (e.g., Location X can produce up to 1,200 parr). If this is the case, a special table can be included that specifies the maximum number of individuals per stage class per life stage per location:\n\n\n\nLocation and stage-specific carrying capacity input data table\n\n\n\nLocation and stage-specific carrying capacity input data table.\n\nThis table (Location-specific capacities) is referred to as the locations carrying capacity table and exists as a special input file that can be used to control density-dependent growth in the life cycle model. Users must estimate the average carrying capacity for a given life stage at each location (e.g., k_stage_1_mean: 1,200) and the interannual variability (CV: coefficient of variation) in the carrying capacity (e.g., k_stage_1_cv: 0.1). If the location carrying capacity table is provided, any cells that are populated with values are assumed to have density-dependent constraints. Any cells that are left blank are assumed to be governed only by density-independent factors and do not have any density-dependent constraints.\nIn the previous example (Location-specific capacities), the population model will run with constraints on stage_1, meaning that the survivorship from stage_0 to stage_1 will be governed by a Beverton-Holt relationship, and the abundance (or density) of stage_1 individuals will be constrained for each location according to the values provided in the locations carrying capacity table.\nThe CEMPRA tool does not support the development of these locations and stage-specific carrying capacity estimates, but it’s assumed that relevant reference literature will be used to develop appropriate input values (e.g., if stage 1 is Steelhead parr; regional densities for Steelhead parr are roughly 1,500 parr/km of stream; and fish-accessible reaches within Rock Creek sum up to roughly 800m in length; then k_stage_1_mean should equal roughly 1,200 parr). Developing these estimates alongside a species profile can be laborious, but the advantage is that projection from the CEMPRA tool will ultimately account for habitat quality and habitat availability.\nIf the locations carrying capacity table is provided, the population projections will implement density-dependent growth constraints for species-specific life stages according to the stage-specific carrying capacities (with Beverton-Holt constraint on growth), and intrinsic density-independent survivorship estimates. The steel head spawners figure shows an example simulation for Steelhead from the CEMPRA tool with adult spawning on the y-axis and a stage-1 (parr) carrying capacity constraint set to 160,000 individuals. In the Steelhead example, the only density-dependent constraint is the parr carrying capacity of the system (set to 160,000). The number of adult spawners is, therefore, a derived metric from the life cycle model. Implementing density-dependent constraints with location and stage-specific carrying capacities is different from the approach with compensation ratios, where users are required to first input an estimate of the adult carrying capacity and work backwards from there.\n\n\n\nSimulation of Steelhead Spawners with stage_1 capacity set to 160,000\n\n\n\nSimulation of Steelhead Spawners (y-axis) with stage_1 (parr) capacity set to 160,000.\n\nLocation and Stage-Specific Carrying Capacities Constraints in the Species Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbh_stage_1, bh_stage_2, bh_stage_3, bh_stage_4\nThe location and stage-specific carrying capacities constraints can be toggled on and off for each life stage with bh_stage_X input in the species profile. Setting the Value to 0 (or omitting the row) means that there will be no density-dependent constraint on a given life stage. Setting the Value to 1 will implement a Beverton-Holt style density-dependent constraint for the given life stage. If implemented, the location and stage-specific carrying capacity input data table must be supplied, and values must be populated for each location.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2 Compensation Ratios for Density-Dependent Growth\nIt is possible to implement density-dependent constraints with both the compensation ratios and the location and stage-specific carrying capacities, but we recommend using only one mechanism for density-dependent growth to avoid confusion.\nCompensation ratios (CR values) can be used in the CEMPRA life cycle model to parameterize and control density-dependent growth. Compensation ratios (described below) are a reparameterization of the classical Beverton-Holt function for density-dependent growth.\nCompensation Ratios (CR) adjust the survivorship of each life stage based on the observed densities (abundance, N i,t) and stage-specific carrying capacities (Ki):\n\n7.5.2.1 Compensation Ratio CR for life stage i:\nThe compensation ratio for life stage i adjusts the survivorship of each life stage based on the observed densities (abundance, Ni,t) and stage-specific carrying capacities (Ki):\n\n\n\nCompensation Ratio CR for life stage i\n\n\nIn the CR equation above, Si,0 is the baseline survivorship (surv_X) under density-independent growth conditions; wi is the compensation ratio (CR value) of life stage i; Ni,t is the current number of individuals in life stage i in a given time step (t); and Ki is the carrying capacity of life stage i. The compensation ratios, in essence, modify the survivorship of each life stage based on how far the stage-specific abundance (Ni,t) has departed from its assumed carrying capacity (Ki).\nA plot of compensation ratios is provided below to illustrate their effects on stage-specific survivorship transitions. In this example, abundance values of a hypothetical stage class (i) are plotted along the x-axis with a carrying capacity (Ki) set to 100 individuals (blue vertical line). The hypothetical stage class (i) has a baseline survivorship (productivity) value of 0.8 in the absence of density-dependent growth conditions (horizontal red line). The y-axis on the plot shows how the default survivorship value of 0.8 is modified based on the stage-specific compensation ratio for stage class (CRi). The survivorship value for the stage class is suppressed as the abundance values exceed the carrying capacity K. The effects are amplified as compensation ratios are increased. Compensation ratios of 1.0 leave the vital rate unmodified. Compensation ratios less than 1.0 increase survivorship values (allowing for a potential positive effect of density). When the abundance of the age class is less than the carrying capacity, baseline survivorship values can actually increase. However, within the model code, adjusted survivorship values are fixed so that they never exceed 1.0 for any stage transition.\n\n\n\nInfluence of compensation ratios on stage-specific survivorship\n\n\n\nInfluence of compensation ratios on stage-specific survivorship.\n\n\n\n7.5.2.2 Stage-Specific Carrying Capacity Estimates:\nWhen using compensation ratios, it is only possible to modify the carrying capacity for the adult age class via the K parameter in the life cycle profile. The K values for other age classes are derived from the stable-stage distribution of the underlying transition matrix. This means that users who implement density-dependent growth via compensation ratios can only modify stage-specific abundance relative to the stable stage distribution. If you know (or can estimate) critical location-specific and stage-specific capacities (e.g., maximum stage_1 parr at location X), then refer to Section 8.4.1 to implement density-dependent growth constraints with location and stage-specific carrying capacities.\nStage-specific capacities (K) with compensation ratios:\n\nK (Stage-0, eggs): Calculated as the product of the number of individuals in all mature age classes, multiplied by maturation probabilities for each class, the number of spawning events, eggs per female, sex ratio and spawning interval.\nK (Stage-0, fry): K values for young-of-the-year (fry/Age-0) individuals are calculated as the product of K (Stage-0, eggs) * the egg survival (SE).\nK (Stage-1): Calculated from the stable-stage distribution of the transition matrix (B) after setting the adult stage (Stage-4) to K (e.g., 100).\nK (Stage-2): Calculated from the stable-stage distribution of the transition matrix (B) after setting the adult stage (Stage-4) to K (e.g., 100).\nK (Stage-3): Calculated from the stable-stage distribution of the transition matrix (B) after setting the adult stage (Stage-4) to K (e.g., 100).\nK (Stage-4): Manually input by the user for the population of interest. This assumes that stage-4 is the only mature age class.\n\nStable-stage distribution (portions) under the example species profile ?fig-figure27:\n\n\n7.5.2.3 Stable Stage Distributions (as a fraction 0 - 1) & Stage-specific Carrying Capacities (K):\n\n\n\nStable Stage Distributions and Stage-specific Carrying Capacities\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2.4 Density-Dependence Matrix (D):\nBased on the derived stage-specific carrying capacities (K values), baseline survivorship values (SE, S0, surv_1, …) and the corresponding compensation ratios (cr_E, cr_0, cr_1, …), a density-dependence matrix (D) for a hypothetical population vector of eggs: 10,000,000, fry: 1,000,000; stage 1: 100,000, stage 2: 10,000, stage 3: 1,000 & stage 4: 100 will appear as follows:\nThe density-dependence matrix (D) contains vital rate modifiers for the estimated survivorship values at each stage transition. The density-dependence matrix (D) is multiplied with the corresponding transition matrix (B, Table 2) of density-independent transition probabilities. The finalized projection matrix (A) is the product of the density-dependent matrix (D), and the transition matrix (B) [A is a product of B*D = A]. The density-dependent matrix changes with each time step based on the number of individuals. The projection matrix (A) is, therefore, recalculated for each time step.\nCompensation ratios are widely used as parameters in stock-recruitment functions, although they are admittedly less popular in classical matrix life cycle modeling. Steepness (the proportion of recruitment produced when stock size is reduced to 20% of initial biomass) is sometimes used in place of compensation ratios. Numerous other methods exist to introduce density dependence into stage-structured life cycle models. The compensation ratios are available as a default option for the CEMPRA tool to represent a versatile mechanism for applications to a large number of hypothetical species profiles. If location and stage-specific carrying capacities can be estimated, we recommend users set all compensation ratios to 1.0 for each stage class (therefore omitting compensation ratios) and refer to Section 8.4.1 for classical density-dependent growth with Beverton-Holt functions. For additional background, please review the following references to learn more about compensation ratios and life cycle modeling with density-dependent growth.\nCompensation Ratios in the Species Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncr_E, cr_0, cr_1, cr_2, cr_3, cr_4\nThe compensation ratios for egg (cr_E), Age-0 fry (cr_0) and subsequent stage classes (cr_1 to cr_4) can be set. If the Nstage value is different than four, then add or remove rows accordingly. Compensation ratios can be set to 1.0 to omit the use of compensation ratios to govern density-dependent growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2.5 Useful references to understand Compensation Ratios:\nTo further understand compensation ratios and their application in life cycle modeling, the following references are recommended:\n\nGoodyear, C.

It’s assumed that good years will be good for large adults and small adults. If multiple mature stage classes contribute to spawning (fecundity) (i.e., maturity values are greater than 0), it is assumed that fecundity will be correlated between good and bad years across stage classes (i.e., stage_5, stage_6 & stage_7). egg_rho controls the degree of correlation in interannual fecundity between stage classes. See the following figure for an illustrative example. If egg_rho is low, and multiple stage classes contribute to spawning, then some stage classes may compensate for good/bad years. Conversely, if egg_rho is high, then the population may be highly volatile as all cohorts experience good/bad years simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\negg_rho: correlation in egg fecundity through time\n\n\n\negg_rho: correlation in egg fecundity through time\n\n\n\n7.6.3 M.cv: Coefficient of Variation (CV) in Interannual Stage-Specific Mortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nM.cv\nThe Coefficient of Variation (CV) in stage-specific mortality (M.cv) is based on a beta distribution.

In natural populations, the occurrence of good and bad years is often correlated across all stage classes, excluding eggs (SE). M.rho determines the degree of this correlation. A low M.rho value suggests that certain stage classes may compensate for good/bad years based on random sampling of survivorship, while a high M.rho implies that all cohorts may experience good/bad years simultaneously, leading to higher volatility in population dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.rho: correlation in survivorship through time\n\n\n\nM.rho: correlation in survivorship through time\n\n\n\n7.6.5 p.cat: Probability of Catastrophe per Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\np.cat\np.cat represents the Probability of Catastrophe per Generation.

The COMPADRE (plant) and COMADRE (animal) online archives also offer vital rates for numerous species as of March 2023 (COMADRE Database). These archives can be valuable resources for reviewing vital rate estimates for similar species and taxa.\nIt’s recommended to first summarize the species’ life cycle using a simple diagram to represent key life stages. This diagram can be converted into a periodicity table (or life history schedule) to represent time spent in each life stage, as shown in the figure. A life history diagram coupled with a periodicity table can be helpful in mapping out transitions between key stages in the life cycle model. Recall that the life cycle model works with annual time steps. “Census” periods within the matrix model do not need to fall precisely at the one-year interval, but care should be taken to ensure that key transitions are not missed or double-counted.

    "section": "7.8 Benefits and Limitations",
    "text": "7.8 Benefits and Limitations\nThe life cycle modeling component of the CEMPRA tool is a valuable resource for understanding and quantifying cumulative effects, linking critical stressors to key life stages, and supporting an understanding of the relevance of key drivers curtailing productivity and capacity. Related analyses have provided a useful framework to synthesize pathways for cumulative effects through the lens of population ecology ((Beechie et al., 2021); (Jorgensen et al., 2021); (Sorel, 2022); (Kendall et al., 2023)). Simulations allow user groups to play out hypothetical scenarios with multiple stressors, locations, and species profiles, making it possible to perform many complex calculations within a simple user interface.\nHowever, there are key limitations to the CEMPRA tool and life cycle modeling in general. Depending on the parameterization of a species profile, there can be key stages and vital rates that are highly sensitive to perturbation. It can be challenging to discern whether these sensitivities reflect actual vulnerabilities in nature or are artifacts of the modeling framework. Therefore, some researchers emphasize the need to treat life cycle models as hypothesis generators until predictions and causal pathways can be empirically validated ((Roni et al., 2018)).\nThe CEMPRA tool does not account for complex variations in life history strategies, seasonal movement, individual exposure, and detailed habitat criteria. Therefore, it’s up to the users to carefully design stressor variables, stressor magnitude datasets, and stressor-response relationships such that linkages are already largely accounted for in the underlying input data. When summarizing results, it is advisable for user groups to focus on reviewing relative differences between scenarios compared to a default (status-quo) reference scenario. Interpreting results as relative differences is more relatable than trying to rationalize absolute values (e.g., “scenario A increased system capacity by ~10% relative to scenario B” vs “scenario A increased capacity by 321 fish relative to scenario B”).\nUser groups and practitioners should use life cycle models to help develop high-level goals for restoration and recovery programs ((Roni et al., 2018)). While useful for identifying key demographic bottlenecks and the sensitivity of those bottlenecks to the range of stressor values observed on the landscape (or projected through simulation), life cycle models are less useful for designing small-scale projects. Efforts should continue to validate and refine predictions with field data and empirical studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeechie, T.

    "text": "11.1 Benefits and Limitations\nThe CEMPRA tool has the flexibility to perform cumulative effects assessments for both data-rich and data-poor species, allowing for the analysis of a range of study systems, including species-at-risk. Various assessment endpoints are available for different use cases. With only four generic input datasets, onboarding new users is intended to be relatively simple.\nThe Joe Modelling component of the CEMPRA tool is a generic assessment framework widely applicable to data-rich and data-limited species. The Joe Model acts as a simplified stressor roll-up framework for watershed assessments. Stressors can be added and manipulated in near real-time in a workshop-like setting. Proven use cases on numerous study systems show how it can be a critical asset to facilitate a shared understanding of watershed stewardship and high-level strategy development for watershed planning.\nThe life cycle modelling component of the CEMPRA tool offers the ability to link stressors to key vital rates in a demographic modelling framework. User groups and practitioners can solicit the life cycle models to help develop high-level goals for restoration and recovery programs ((Roni et al., 2018)). Life cycle models are useful to identify key demographic bottlenecks and the sensitivity of those bottlenecks to the range of stressor values observed on the landscape (or projected through scenario simulation).\nThe CEMPRA framework should be considered a simple approach to cumulative effects assessments. It provides the greatest utility for large-scale planning activities at the intersection between different user groups and stakeholders. The intent of the CEMPRA tool is to provide a working framework for both data-rich and data-limited species with alternative assessment endpoints. Stressor-response relationships are the underlying theme of the CEMPRA tool. Our hope is that the CEMPRA will support the development of a collaborative user community, reducing duplicated efforts in the development of stressor variables, species profiles and assessment frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nRoni, P., Anders, P.

    "section": "A.1 Customizable Two-Factor Interaction Matrix",
    "text": "A.1 Customizable Two-Factor Interaction Matrix\nCustomizable 2-factor interaction matrices may be (optionally) included by users to specify non-additive interactions between stressor variables (e.g., antagonistic, synergistic, etc.). If included, these matrices define the mean system capacity at different combination levels between two stressors. This can be especially important to capture conditional effects, attenuating or exacerbating factors, and/or compound variance and uncertainties. The 2-factor interaction matrices can also be a convenient mechanism to explore hypothetical and experimental scenarios.\nThe 2-factor interaction matrices are defined in the Stressor-Response Excel workbook. Template matrices are available in the R-Shiny application and sample datasets (see upload data tab). The data input format of the 2-factor interaction matrix is designed to be relatively flexible and accommodate both simple and more complex use cases. Similar to the single stressor-response functions, the 2-factor matrix is constructed by the user using data or expert opinion, depending on data availability.\nA hypothetical example (Figure 1) is included to show the interaction between stream canopy cover (low to high) and nutrients (as total Phosphorous). At low nutrients, habitat capacity for trout is highest under low canopy cover, where high light maximizes algal and invertebrate production (red circle). However, at high nutrients (eutrophic conditions), habitat capacity is highest under a closed canopy that suppresses algal growth and associated high temperatures and poor water quality (blue circle).\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: Example interaction surface for the CEMPRA 2-factor interaction matrix between trout capacity canopy cover and nutrients."

    "section": "A.2 Data Preparation",
    "text": "A.2 Data Preparation\nThe 2-factor interaction matrices are optionally included as additional tabs in the stressor response workbook. The formatting must follow Figure 2. The worksheet name must begin with “MInt_” followed by a unique name (ideally without spaces). In this example we used “MInt_AB”.\n\n\n\nFigure A.2: Example Matrix interaction surface for stressor variables A and B.\n\n\nThe header section of the workbook must include several inputs:\n\nMatrix Name (cell B1): A custom name given to the 2-way interaction (for personal reference purposes). This name should match the worksheet name (e.g., MInt_AB). Try to avoid using spaces or special characters outside of MInt_.\nColumns (cell B2): The name of the stressor variable representing the column header values in the system capacity table. In the previous example column header values in the subsequent tables will map onto this stressor. Ensure that the spelling of the stressor matches the spelling throughout the rest of the workbook.\nRows (B3): The name of the stressor variable representing the row names in the system capacity table. In the previous example row names in the subsequent tables will map onto this stressor. Ensure that the spelling of the stressor matches the spelling throughout the rest of the workbook.\nMain Effects: Specify whether the system capacity estimates in the 2-factor interaction matrix account for (include) the main effects. Options for cell B4 can be either “Included” or “Excluded”.\n\nIncluded: When cell B4 is set to “Included” the system capacity estimates are intended to represent the entire relationship between the two stressors at their respective levels (main effects and interactive effects combined). If the main effects option is set to “Included” the cumulative system capacity calculation will be adjusted to automatically omit both of the univariate stressor-response relationships (if they have been specified in the stressor-response workbook) and only evaluate their combined effect from the 2-factor interaction matrix. This modification is necessary to avoid double counting the effects of each stressor.\nFor example, if the Stressor-Response workbook contained stressor-response worksheets for “Nutrients”, “Canopy_Cover” and an interactive matrix (e.g., “Matrix_1”) for “Nutrients and Canopy_Cover”, then the Joe Model would only evaluate system capacity values from the matrix and discard the univariate effects with the assumption that they are already accounted for in the matrix capacity data (Y = “VarA” + “VarB” + “Nutrients and Canopy_Cover”).\nExcluded (experimental – apply with caution): Setting cell B4 (Main Effects) to “Excluded” indicates that the interaction surface only describes the interactive effects and that the main effects (defined in the other stressor-response worksheets) must remain in the cumulative system capacity calculation. If the “Excluded” option is selected, the 2-factor interaction matrix ultimately acts as an additional stressor variable to modify the system capacity score. Setting the main effects to “Excluded” is convenient when users wish to quickly evaluate scenarios with and without customized interactive effects.\n\n\nImportant Note: The implementation of interactive effects and main effects in the CEMPRA tool is different from a conventional logistic regression equation. There is no intercept, context-dependent coefficients, or link function. The interactive effect is simply added into the formula like any other stressor. For example, if the Stressor-Response workbook contained stressor-response worksheets for “Nutrients”, “Canopy_Cover” and an interactive matrix (e.g., “Matrix_1”) for “Nutrients and Canopy_Cover”, then the Joe Model would incorporate all three terms into the equation as stressor-response terms (Y = “VarA” + “VarB” + “Nutrients” + “Canopy Cover” + “Nutrients and Canopy_Cover”).\nThe difference between the 2-factor interaction matrix calculations with the main effects “Included” and “Excluded” is further illustrated in the following figure:\n\n\n\nFigure A.3: Difference between main effects being included or excluded from 2-factor interaction matrix summary. The Interaction factor for main effects Excluded (X) will be different (in this case lower) than for main effects Included.\n\n\nThe formatting of the matrix worksheet allows for some flexibility (see example below), but the variable inputs in cells B1:B4 must be kept in their original positions. For each stressor variable, the user can define any number of steps (intervals) provided that the stressor column variable (x-axis) starts in cell C6 and extends right (associated with columns – B2), and the stressor row variable (y-axis) starts in cell B7 and extends downward (associated with rows – B3 stressor). See figure Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure A.4: Matrices of different resolutions.\n\n\nIf values in the stressor magnitude workbook do not align exactly with stressor values in the column and row heads of the interaction matrix, then the system capacity value will be calculated with linear interpolation. NULL or missing values from the stressor magnitude workbook will omit the HUC or subbasin assessment unit from any calculation of habitat capacity or cumulative effects.\nCommon Errors and Issues:\n\nOrder stressors with values increasing: Matrix column and row header values must be sorted non-decreasingly and contain no NA values or blank values. For example, 800, 600, 400 should be reordered as 400, 600, 800 in either the row or column headers for each stressor.\nKeep template clean: Format of template has been altered or additional content is placed in rows or columns to the left or below matrix tables.\nErrors in header and meta data"

    "section": "Executive Summary",
    "text": "Executive Summary\nThe Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA) is a cumulative effects modelling framework. The CEMPRA tool uses a series of standardized user-defined stressor-response functions to link environmental attributes to the system capacity and productivity of a target species/system. This framework design is as generalizable, simple, and versatile as possible so that users can apply the model to various geographic regions, contexts, systems, and species. As the name suggests, the CEMPRA tool helps prioritize recovery actions for data-limited species and species-at-risk, with the flexibility to accommodate both data-rich and data-poor study systems and to facilitate and efficient transition from simple to complex modelling within a single platform as more information becomes available for a target species. The CEMPRA is intended as a low-barrier tool and is accessible as an open-source R package (https://github.com/essatech/CEMPRA) and R Shiny interactive web application (https://github.com/essatech/CEMPRAShiny).\nStressor-response functions form the foundation of the CEMPRA tool. A stressor variable is broadly characterized as an environmental driver resulting in an observable biological response in a target population ((Pirotta et al., 2022); (Rosenfeld et al., 2022); (Jarvis et al., 2023)). Within the CEMPRA tool, stressors represent and capture various metrics of cumulative effects (direct or proximal) and their associated impact pathways (e.g., stream temperature, sedimentation, habitat loss).\nStressor-response functions are developed for each metric in a standardized format and linked to population-level productivity (mean system capacity, usually expressed as density or total abundance of the adult population in the basic Joe model) or specific vital rates within a life cycle modelling framework. Users then populate a matching table of stressor-magnitude values linked to various locations (spatial units) of interest. Finally, the CEMPRA tool runs to generate stochastic simulations of the study system under different user-defined management or recovery scenarios. Comparisons between scenarios are commonly made against a default reference (status quo) scenario. Scenarios generally consist of various “alternative futures” to characterize potential impacts from development activities and/or alternative restoration/recovery efforts. Comparisons between scenarios can be quantitative (e.g., looking at a weighted mean system capacity or relative productivity) or qualitative by simply looking at a heatmap of stressors across the landscape.\nThere are two modelling pathways and associated endpoints within the CEMPRA framework: 1) the first is the basic Joe Model that estimates system capacity (a generalized response metric, typically represented by percent of maximum adult population size since it is a single-stage model); and 2) a stage-structured life cycle model, where stressor-response relationships are directly linked to specific life stages and vital rates. The life cycle model allows users to adjust vital rate parameters to estimate cumulative effects at the population level and is intended for data-rich populations or species. The combination of the Joe model and life-cycle model embedded within the CEMPRA framework allows flexibility to handle data-poor and data-rich species within the same platform.\nAdditional supporting resources are being developed to facilitate ease of use and collaboration between individuals studying cumulative effects. These resources include the development of an online stressor-response library (digital archive), example species profiles of population vital rates for running the life cycle model, case studies, and tutorial resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nJarvis, L., Rosenfeld, J., Gonzalez-Espinosa, P., & Enders, E.

    "section": "C.1 1.1 Designing Restoration Action Scenarios",
    "text": "C.1 1.1 Designing Restoration Action Scenarios\nThe socio-economic component of CEMPRA largely consists of a template workbook with pre-defined functions to automate calculations. However, it is up the user to define the restoration scenarios that are most applicable to their study system and to populate scenarios with attributes for cost-benefit applications. Part of the value of the socio-economic module is that it forces the user to be explicit and empirical about the expected costs and benefits of expected interventions.\nPrior to running restoration scenarios in the socio-economic module, an initial brainstorming session should take place. The purpose of this session is to shortlist the most appropriate restoration actions for evaluation. Working groups should broadly consider target management actions, determine if they are appropriate for modelling or whether they should be evaluated outside of the CEMPRA tool, define an appropriate spatial unit for calculations (see details below) and then think about and define the direct linkages between restoration actions and stressor reductions.\n\n\n\n\nSequence of steps for identifying the costs and consequences of each restoration action type evaluated in the socio-economic component of CEMPRA.\n\n\n\nThe sequence of steps for defining the cost and effects of recovery interventions before running scenarios in the socio-economic component of the tool is outlined in Figure 2.\n\nIdentify target restoration actions: Working through the costs and benefits of restoration action types one at a time is recommended. Examples of restoration action types may include off-channel habitat creation, riparian planting, barrier removal, gravel augmentation, the addition of large woody debris, the installation of beaver dam analogues, etc.\nDetermine if the target restoration action is appropriate for this tool: Various action types may be more or less suitable for evaluation in the socio-economic module. The tool works best with concrete actions that can be explicitly quantified in terms of system capacity, and unsuited to evaluate actions that provide abstract or intangible benefits. It will likely be difficult to apply to management actions that are highly complex, overly context-dependent, or can only be qualitatively described at a high level. For example, hatchery interventions may be a valuable action type for a target watershed/population, but it may be challenging to evaluate within the module because of the difficulty including very real impacts on genetic diversity or hybridization with wild stocks. Similarly, actions like public education, large barrier/dam removals, etc., while essential components of restoration planning, may be inappropriate.\nDefine an appropriate standardized unit of measurement for calculating the impact of each action type: For each type of intervention, users must define a representative unit for calculating impact. Spatial units may be defined as linear distances (e.g., kilometres of stream restored), areas (e.g., m²), etc. The intent is to perform cost-benefit calculations per measurement unit for each action type. For example, an appropriate spatial unit for riparian planting could be a linear distance (e.g., per kilometre of stream planted), or an area (buffer width x length) depending on application. Off-channel habitat development, on the other hand, could be expressed in terms of the area of habitat created (e.g., m²). Point features such as beaver dam analogues (BDAs) and/or LWD placements might be expressed in terms of total area, or as an absolute value (i.e., number of BDAs) and then converted into a linear density (e.g., number of units per kilometre of stream).\nDefine the boundaries and size of each location (e.g., spatial polygon or linear reach): The system (e.g., stream or watershed) must be divided into spatial units (e.g., polygons or reaches) that collectively make up the target system (e.g., stream or watershed). Users must also define the relative size of each spatial unit (referred to hereafter as a “location”) for appropriate weighting. For example, consider evaluating three locations (defined as stream reaches or subbasins). Assume location A contains 5 km of stream, location B contains 4 km, and location C contains 1 km. If a restoration program did 1 km of riparian planting at each location, we would expect that the relative impact would be greater for location C relative to location A (ignoring their interconnectivity in a hydrologic network). Similarly, if we were to consider the relative benefit of a program that created off-channel habitat, we would want to know the relative habitat area of each location, to allow calculation of the relative decrease in the stressor represented by off-channel habitat loss (Figure 3). The goal here is to convert each of the restoration interventions into location-specific stressor reduction estimates to perform cost-benefit calculations (e.g., kilometres of stream planted per total kilometres of stream at Location X (%), area of off-channel habitat created relative to the total habitat area at Location X (%), number of BDAs per kilometre, number of pieces of LWD per 100 m of stream, volume (m³) of LWD per length of stream etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition of off-channel habitat scaled by total habitat area pre-restoration.\n\n\n\n\nDefine Functional Linkages Between Restoration Actions and Stressors: Linkages between restoration action types and stressors specify how each intervention can decrease stressor magnitudes and (presumably) increase system capacity. Note that restoration actions may be linked to one or more stressors. For example, riparian planting might decrease summer stream temperatures, but may also reduce sediment or nutrient inputs, thereby linking to multiple stressors.\nCalculate System Capacity Increase Associated With Restoration Interventions (on a per unit area basis): The final component of data input preparation (not including estimation of costs; see below) involves the creation of custom functions linking the magnitude of management intervention to reduction in the target stressor (stressor reduction functions, e.g., defining how stream temperature decreases with the extent of riparian planting). This exercise forces the user to be explicit about the expected response to the management intervention and confront and define any uncertainty. All estimates and calculations are performed on a per-unit-area basis (e.g., m²). The input workbook design is flexible so that restoration interventions can be linked to stressor magnitude levels or directly to stressor response values. Stressor reduction functions are discussed in further detail in the next section.\n\n\nRemember, projections using the socio-economic component of the CEMPRA tool are only as reliable as the data that go into them. Using restoration benefit and cost estimates from the literature will inevitably entail considerable error, and projection error will likely increase with the complexity of restoration scenarios. Users need to remember that any uncertainty in cost and stressor reduction functions for management interventions will be additive to existing uncertainties associated with underlying SR functions and stressor magnitude estimates in different spatial polygons. Inferences should be tempered accordingly, and when uncertainty is high, projections should be recognized as back-of-the-envelope calculations or hypotheses."

Again, this process forces the user to be explicit about the anticipated costs of restoration interventions, as well as their potential effectiveness. Cost estimates can be included as a dollar amount (with uncertainty) or included semi-quantitatively with a customized scoring system (e.g., 1 = low, 2.5 = moderate, 5 = high etc.). Cost estimates are provided on a per-unit basis (e.g., cost per BDA, cost per kilometer of riparian stream bank planting, or cost per m² of off-channel habitat creation, etc.). Location-specific cost modifiers can also be provided for local adjustments from global means, i.e., when site access is particularly bad, off-channel habitat construction costs might be 50% higher than the global mean (cost multiplier of 1.5)."

    "text": "C.3 1.3 Socio-economic Input Excel Workbook\nThe socio-economic input workbook is supplied to CEMPRA as a separate Excel workbook. Each worksheet within the Excel workbook contains information for each type of planned management action, the magnitude of the action (intervention level) at each location, the ability of each action to reduce a stressor and the corresponding stressor-response reduction, and the per-unit cost of each intervention (i.e., all of the key attributes described above).\n\nA sample Socio-Economic Excel workbook can be found here: Socio-economic Input Workbook\n\n\nC.3.1 Worksheets\n\nManagement Actions: Provides an overview of the management interventions that have been shortlisted for evaluation. This workbook is used to define action-specific attributes such as the cost measurement unit and cost per unit for each management action type.\nLocation Implementation: This workbook defines the magnitude of the proposed management actions for each location. Each line in the workbook provides attributes for each specific management action applied to each specific location (i.e., the level of intervention by tributary or reach, depending on the scale at which locations are defined). The workbook also contains estimates for the relative size of each location (with respect to each management action type).\nLocation Size Attributes: Cumulative effects modelling with the Joe Model focuses on the relative status and condition among user-defined polygons (e.g., watersheds), but it does not explicitly consider habitat area or the size of each polygon. This worksheet allows users to specify location-specific size and area attributes. Defining these attributes becomes important when evaluating stressor reduction from a given intervention, since the habitat stressor is usually expressed as percent loss or gain relative to the total area of habitat available in a polygon (location).\nStressor Reduction: The stressor reduction workbook defines the relationship between each management action type and stressor levels. Each row in the stressor reduction workbook must have a unique identifier in the “Stress Reduction Curve ID” column (e.g., SR1, SR2, SR3… etc.) that links the restoration intervention to a particular stressor. Subsequent Excel worksheets should be labelled to match the IDs in this column (e.g., SR1, SR2… etc.). The “SR” “#” worksheets define the functional relationships between each stressor and restoration action.\n\n\nSR1: Action: “Riparian Planting” and Stressor: “August Stream Temperature”.\n\n\nSR2: Action: “Riparian Planting” and Stressor: “Riparian Habitat Condition”.\n\n\nSR3: Action: “Off Channel Habitat Creation” and Stressor: “Habitat Loss”.\n\n\nSR#: …\n\n\n\nC.3.2 1.3.1 Management Actions Excel Worksheet\n\nFigure 4a. Example of the CEMPRA socio-economic input worksheet for the ‘Management Actions’ with four unique action types represented in the simulation.\n\n\nCreate a new row for each unique management action type. For each unique management action, define the following features:\n\n\nManagement Action Core Attributes:\n\n\nManagement Action Name: The unique name for a management action. Ensure that the spelling is consistent across all worksheets. Avoid the use of special characters or symbols.\nRepresentative Measurement Unit: Define the measurement unit for the target restoration action type. The measurement unit should be defined as the most appropriate metric for each management intervention. For example, linear developments (e.g., bank stabilization, riparian planting) might reference units such as meters (m) or kilometers (km) of stream length. Area-based developments (e.g., riparian planting, off-channel habitat development, spawning channels) could reference meters squared (m²), hectares (ha) or even aggregates (such as 100 m²) of wetted stream area. Point features that consist of discrete structures could simply use feature counts (e.g., number of BDAs, LWD, culverts, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Action Cost Attributes:\n\n\nMean Cost per Measurement Unit: Define the mean cost to implement each management action on a per-measurement unit basis. For example, if the measurement unit for riparian planting was 1 kilometre of stream, then the mean cost per unit would be defined as the cost of implementing riparian planting for one kilometre of stream length (although this could also be treated as an area, e.g., length x riparian buffer width).\nSD of Cost per Unit (optional): Define the uncertainty in the cost estimate (as the standard deviation of cost) for stochastic simulations. Stochastic simulations will sample cost estimates for each location following a normal distribution with the user-defined mean and SD. This is an optional feature - if this cell is left blank then the program will assume no cost uncertainty.\nLower Limit of Cost per Unit (optional): Define the lower limit of cost per unit for stochastic simulations. Regardless of the user-supplied SD value, the cost sample in stochastic simulations will never fall below this value. Note that this is also an optional feature and will only be used if a SD is specified.\nUpper Limit of Cost per Unit (optional): Define the upper limit of cost per unit for stochastic simulations. Regardless of the user-supplied SD value, the cost sample in stochastic simulations will never exceed this value. Note that this is also an optional feature and will only be used if a SD is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5b. Illustration of how unit costs can change with economies of scale using the example discount multipliers for BDAs in Fig. 3a. The unit cost for each BDA is discounted by 20% for each multiple of 10 BDAs.\n\n\nBulk Discounts Thresholds for Economies of Scale (optional): This feature provides the option to define thresholds for bulk discounts and possible economies of scale (i.e., decreased costs with larger projects; see Fig. 3b). The base mean cost of each management action will reference the value specified in column C. However, suppose the number of units in the “Location Implementation” tab exceeds a bulk discount unit threshold specified. In that case, the bulk discount cost multiplier (0 – 1) will be applied to the mean cost per unit to reduce the unit cost. For example, if BDAs are estimated to cost an average of $500 per unit (without the bulk discount) but are only expected to cost an average of $400 per unit if more than 10 units can be constructed, then the “Bulk Discount Units Threshold (Level 1)” would be set to 10 and the “Bulk Discount Price Multiplier (Level 1)” would be set to 0.8 ($400/$500). The workbook lets working groups specify two tiers for economies of scale: Level 1 and Level 2.\n\n\nBulk Discount Units Threshold (Level 1): Unit threshold required to activate Level 1 cost multiplier.\nBulk Discount Price Multiplier (Level 1): Mean cost multiplier once Level 1 threshold is achieved.\nBulk Discount Units Threshold (Level 2): Unit threshold required to activate Level 2 cost multiplier.\nBulk Discount Price Multiplier (Level 2): Mean cost multiplier once Level 2 threshold is achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Action Subcategories:\n\nIf a management action type consists of two or more subcategories, create multiple rows to represent each unique variation of the target management action (Fig. 3a). For example, riparian planting might be split into two categories: a.) riparian planting within two meters of the stream bank and b.) riparian planting within ten meters of the stream bank. It is recommended (if possible) to represent management action variants as separate rows to simplify subsequent calculations (e.g., Riparian Planting 2m; Riparian Planting 10m).\n\n\n\n\n\nC.3.3 Location Implementation Worksheet\nThe Location Implementation Excel worksheet (Fig. 4) defines the level of proposed management actions (i.e., level of intervention) for each restoration action type associated with each spatial unit (location). Each line in the Location Implementation workbook provides attributes for a specific management action type applied at a specific location. The matching “Location Size Attributes” worksheet (Fig. 5) contains estimates of the absolute size of each location (i.e., stream length or habitat area) and is described in detail in the following section.\n\nLocation ID: The unique location ID field (or HUC ID field) associated with the stressor magnitude input workbook and locations GIS polygon layer for mapping in CEMPRA.\nLocation Name: Optional but recommended to include for convenience (e.g., Rock Creek). All computational data lookups use the Location ID field.\nManagement Action Name: Name of the management action referenced from the Management Actions input worksheet. Ensure spelling/punctuation exactly matches between worksheets. Include separate rows for each management action to be applied at a given location.\nRepresentative Measurement Unit: Optional (column can be left blank). The measurement unit from the Management Actions worksheet for the target restoration action type is repeated here for convenience (and personal reference when filling out the spreadsheet).\n\nManagement Action Intervention Attributes: Define the level of restoration at each location (in terms of the measurement of units designated in the Management Actions Worksheet). These columns define the location-specific extent of modelled restoration actions. Mean, SD, and lower/upper limit columns are provided to represent a range of possible values. The SD column can be set to zero to run simulations without stochasticity.\n\nMean Number of Units Restored (i.e., area in m2, number of BDAs, etc.): Provide a numeric value using the measurement units that reference the specific restoration action type (e.g., number of BDAs to install, kilometres of stream to implement riparian planting, etc.). Try to define a mean or average value for the given location.\nSD Number of Units: Optionally, users can define uncertainty in the level of restoration action to introduce stochasticity into the simulation. Set this value to zero to reference the mean value without stochasticity.\nLower Limit for Number of Units: Define the lower limit for stochastic simulations.\nUpper Limit of Cost per Unit: Define the upper limit for stochastic simulations.\nLocation Cost Multiplier (optional): Optionally define a location cost multiplier for a specific location. This column should only be used if it is believed that a specific restoration action will be more costly (or significantly cheaper) if applied at a specific location (e.g., one with poor vs. good access, on-site building materials, etc.). The column can be left blank if reference unit costs are considered accurate. Any location cost multiplier will be used to adjust the ‘Mean Cost per Unit’ (in the Management Actions worksheet) at the specific location (similar to the “Bulk discount multiplier”). For example, to reduce cost by 10%, set the location cost multiplier to 0.9 (‘Mean Cost per Unit’ * 0.9 = a 10% discount, or 90% of the original cost); to increase cost, set the value to something greater than 1 (e.g., a value of 1.2 will increase costs by 20% at a given location).\nLocation Effect Multiplier (optional): Optionally define a location effect multiplier for a specific location. This column should only be used if it is believed that a specific restoration action will be significantly more or less effective at a given location. We don’t expect this to be a common feature. However, if it’s decided that a certain management action would only be half as effective at location relative to other locations, then use a value of 0.5. Conversely, if a management action is expected to be twice as effective at a given location, then a value of 2 could be provided. The location effect multiplier will be applied to the mean number of units restored. :::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Example of the Location Implementation worksheet for CEMPRA socio-economic modelling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC.3.4 Location Size Attributes Worksheet\nThe Joe Model focuses on the relative status and condition among locations or spatial polygons, but it does not explicitly consider habitat area or the size of each polygon or spatial unit (e.g., location, HUC, or reach). Defining the absolute quantity (or extent) of a restoration action relative to the size of the location or spatial unit becomes essential when evaluating the relative impact and cost of the intervention. This worksheet allows users to specify location-specific size and area attributes (for both the restoration intervention and the location/polygon where it takes place) so that the socio-economic module can calculate stressor reduction potential.\nThe yellow highlighted attribute area columns represent the current (baseline) area/extent of habitat features that are targeted for restoration such as stream length, stream area, current off-channel habitat, total spawning habitat, total pool habitat, etc. Columns for three of the most common habitat features including total stream length (which could be increased by barrier removal), total stream area, and off-channel habitat are included by default, but users can define their own custom column names to replace the “…” placeholder values in adjacent columns; each column the user defines should be associated with at least one specific restoration action type included in the Management Actions worksheet, and also match the associated habitat measurement units. The defined area/extent attributes are then used as the current baseline condition to convert location-specific restoration actions (defined in the Location Implementation worksheet) into a standardized restoration effort per area associated with each intervention (e.g., # of BDAs per kilometre of stream; total length of riparian planting relative to the total stream length, total off-channel habitat created relative to the current quantity of off-channel habitat etc.). Location-specific stressor reductions are then calculated by linking area-standardized restoration effort to stressor levels using stressor-reduction functions, as described in section 1.3.4 below.\n\nTable 1. Example pairings of spatial units for popular management action types, corresponding spatial units for management actions, spatial units to represent the size of each location/polygon, and the corresponding restoration effort per area metric for linking habitat restoration to stressor reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Action Name\nManagement Action Spatial Measurement Unit\nLocation Total Area or Length Unit (suggested values)\nRestoration Effort per Unit Area\n\n\n\n\nRiparian Planting\nkm planted\nkm of stream within the location or polygon\nkm planted per km of stream\n\n\nOff Channel Habitat\nm² of off-channel habitat created\nTotal Current Off-Channel Habitat m²\nRatio of new:current off-channel habitat\n\n\nBDA\nNumber of BDAs (#)\nkm of stream within the location or polygon\n# of BDAs / km of stream (density)\n\n\nLWD\nNumber of LWD (#)\nkm of stream within the location or polygon\n# of LWD / km of stream (density)\n\n\n\n\nLocation ID: The unique location ID field (or HUC ID field) associated with the stressor magnitude input workbook and locations GIS polygon layer.\n\n\nLocation Name: This is optional, but specifying relevant labels (e.g., Rock Creek) is recommended for convenience in keeping track of restoration sites. However, all data lookups use the Location ID field above rather than the location name.\n\n\nYellow Highlighted Columns: Change or modify the name of the yellow highlighted columns to define the current area, length, or other metric of baseline extent of habitat associated with the target restoration actions; these are user-defined and will vary depending on the habitat types targeted for restoration (e.g., total length of stream if removing barriers; or spawning, rearing, etc. habitat if restoration is life-stage-specific). Ensure that column names in columns C:J exactly match the values used in column D (location baseline size scaling column) in the “Stressor Reduction” worksheet. Use columns C and D as examples.\n\n\no Stream length (km): Sometimes stream length might be a valuable unit to use to represent the size of each location (e.g., riparian planting is represented as length of stream planted relative to total stream length)\n\n\no Stream area (m²): Common unit for in-stream restoration projects (e.g., off-channel habitat and side channel creation could be expressed relative to total stream area at a location)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Location Size Attributes worksheet for stressor reduction calculations\n\n\n\nC.3.5 Stressor Reduction Worksheet\nThe stressor reduction workbook (see Figure 7 below) defines the relationship between each management action type and the predicted reduction in stressor level. This can be thought of as defining novel “stressor-response” functions where the management intervention is the “stressor” (x-axis), and the stressor becomes the response (y-axis). Each row in the stressor reduction workbook must have a unique identifier in the “Stress Reduction Curve ID” column (e.g., SR1, SR2, SR3… etc.) that is associated with a specific stressor being affected by a management intervention. These identifiers should exactly match the names of the associated “SR#” Excel worksheets that define each Stressor Reduction function in more detail (see section 1.3.7 below). Note that each management action may affect more than one stressor, resulting in multiple rows (and therefore SR# worksheets) for a given intervention.\nRestoration effort per unit area is the x-axis on all stressor reduction functions, and it links the management action to stressor reductions (y-axis). Restoration effort per unit area (or length) scales the absolute quantity of restoration effort to a standardized unit of area (or length). For example, the total number of pieces of LWD placed at a location will commonly be divided by the total stream length at the location to convert # of LWD placements into # LWD placements per km of stream. Expressing restoration action in terms of “densities” (i.e., effort per area or length) is essential to standardize stressor reduction functions across restoration scenarios.\n\nStress Reduction Curve ID: The stressor reduction curve ID for each row in the Stressor Reduction worksheet represents a unique relationship between a restoration action and a stressor. SR# IDs are linked to associated worksheets (Figure 8) that define each stressor reduction function (unique relationships between standardized restoration effort (x-axis) and specific stressor levels (y-axis)).\n\n\nManagement Intervention Name: Name of management action. Ensure spelling matches name of management action in both the Location Implementation and Management Actions worksheets.\n\n\nMeasurement Unit for Management Action: References the “Measurement Unit” from the “Management Actions” worksheet (e.g., # of LWD placements, m², km). Included here for convenience and reference.\n\n\nLocation Baseline Size Scaling Column: The location baseline size scaling column references one of columns C:J representing the total baseline (pre-intervention) habitat area (or length) in the “Location Size Attributes” worksheet. The location size scaling column is used as the denominator to divide the absolute quantity of a management action implemented at a given location (e.g., number of BDAs, number of LWD placements, total off-channel habitat created, total length of stream planted, etc.) by the baseline size of that specific habitat at the location/polygon (e.g., total length of stream, total stream area, existing off-channel habitat etc.). This generates a standardized metric of restoration effort per unit area (or length), i.e., relative “density” of restoration outcomes (e.g., number of BDAs per kilometer of stream).\n\n\nRestoration Effort per Unit Area (or Length): This defines the units that are used for linking the standardized restoration effort to stressor reduction functions across all locations. Restoration effort per unit area or length is calculated as the absolute quantity of a restoration action at a given location (in terms of the measurement unit for each management action) divided by the total size of the associated habitat at a location (location baseline size scaling column). The resulting metric becomes the x-axis variable in the associated stressor reduction functions described below.\n\n\nAffected Stressor: This column should be populated with one of the original stressor response curve ID labels from the original stressor response workbook used to run the Joe Model. Ensure that spelling matches the “Stressors” column from the “Main” worksheet of the Stressor Response input workbook. Note that specific restoration actions may be linked to one or more stressors; to define linkages between a single management intervention and multiple stressors, use additional rows to represent each unique relationship between a management action and a different stressor (e.g., riparian planting may reduce both temperature and sediment).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Derived restoration effort per unit area (or length) metric to link scale of restoration action at each location to stressor reduction functions.\n\n\nStress Reduction Curve ID: The stressor reduction curve ID for each row in the Stressor Reduction worksheet represents a unique relationship between a restoration action and a stressor. SR# IDs are linked to associated worksheets (Figure 8) that define each stressor reduction function (unique relationships between standardized restoration effort (x-axis) and specific stressor levels (y-axis)).\n\n\nManagement Intervention Name: Name of management action. Ensure spelling matches name of management action in both the Location Implementation and Management Actions worksheets.\n\n\nMeasurement Unit for Management Action: References the “Measurement Unit” from the “Management Actions” worksheet (e.g., # of LWD placements, m², km). Included here for convenience and reference.\n\n\nLocation Baseline Size Scaling Column: The location baseline size scaling column references one of columns C:J representing the total baseline (pre-intervention) habitat area (or length) in the “Location Size Attributes” worksheet. The location size scaling column is used as the denominator to divide the absolute quantity of a management action implemented at a given location (e.g., number of BDAs, number of LWD placements, total off-channel habitat created, total length of stream planted, etc.) by the baseline size of that specific habitat at the location/polygon (e.g., total length of stream, total stream area, existing off-channel habitat etc.). This generates a standardized metric of restoration effort per unit area (or length), i.e., relative “density” of restoration outcomes (e.g., number of BDAs per kilometer of stream).\n\n\nRestoration Effort per Unit Area (or Length): This defines the units that are used for linking the standardized restoration effort to stressor reduction functions across all locations. Restoration effort per unit area or length is calculated as the absolute quantity of a restoration action at a given location (in terms of the measurement unit for each management action) divided by the total size of the associated habitat at a location (location baseline size scaling column). The resulting metric becomes the x-axis variable in the associated stressor reduction functions described below.\n\n\nAffected Stressor: This column should be populated with one of the original stressor response curve ID labels from the original stressor response workbook used to run the Joe Model. Ensure that spelling matches the “Stressors” column from the “Main” worksheet of the Stressor Response input workbook. Note that specific restoration actions may be linked to one or more stressors; to define linkages between a single management intervention and multiple stressors, use additional rows to represent each unique relationship between a management action and a different stressor (e.g., riparian planting may reduce both temperature and sediment).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Example of the Stressor Reduction worksheet linking restoration actions to stressors.\n\n\n\nC.3.6 Stressor Reduction Function Worksheet\nThe final data input requirement for the socio-economic component of this CEMPRA tool is the stressor reduction (SR) function worksheets. The stressor reduction worksheets characterize each unique relationship between a restoration action type and an affected stressor. Each SR worksheet must be described as a row in the linked ‘Stressor Reduction’ overview worksheet and referenced in the associated ‘Stressor Reduction Curve ID’ column (e.g., SR1, SR2…, etc.).\nEach stressor reduction worksheet specifies how increasing levels of a restoration action will change stressor levels at a given location. When the Joe Model is run within the CEMPRA tool, the stressor magnitude values will be adjusted based on the effects specified by the Stressor Reduction functions to produce a modified response after restoration actions are applied. Restoration actions modify each location/polygon’s stressor levels (the x-axis component of the stressor response functions). For example, if a given restoration action has the potential to modify stream temperature (a stressor variable) by -2°C, the original stressor level (from the stressor magnitude workbook) will be set to a new value (e.g., 17°C - 2°C = 15°C).\n\nFigure 10. Sample stressor reduction workbook for riparian planting (the restoration action) and stream temperatures (the stressor that is reduced by riparian planting).\n\nStressor Reduction (SR) worksheet columns:\n\nColumn A: Level of Restoration Action: Values in column A specify the standardized level of the restoration action at a given location (e.g., km planted/km of stream). Column A should consist of numeric values with units matching the restoration effort per unit area metric. This column should also contain a header.\n\n\nColumn B: Change in Stressor Magnitude Levels: Values in column B should specify how the stressor magnitude levels will change for a given level of restoration action. Values in column B directly modify current (baseline) stressor magnitude values by addition. Therefore, if the mechanism involves a decrease in the absolute values of a stressor, these values should be negative. If the restoration action increases stressor magnitude levels, these values should be positive. This column should also contain a header.\n\n\nColumn C: SD for Change in Stressor Magnitude Levels: In many cases, there will be uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of a restoration action. This uncertainty can be represented with stochastic simulations. Set the SD values here to randomly draw a value from a normal distribution with a mean (Column B) and SD (column C). This column should also contain the header “SD”.\n\n\nColumn D: Lower Limit for Change in Stressor Magnitude Levels: This column sets a lower limit for stochastic simulations when randomly sampling a change in stressor magnitude levels with stochastic simulations.\n\n\nColumn E: Upper Limit for Change in Stressor Magnitude Levels: This column sets an upper limit for stochastic simulations when randomly sampling a change in stressor magnitude levels with stochastic simulations."

    "text": "7.4 Matrix Representations\n\n7.4.1 Iteroparous (Non-anadromous) Species\nWe can combine all parameters discussed in this section along with the example species profile to construct a symbolic (mathematical) representation of the transition matrix (Table 1). The stage-to-stage transitions account for the probability of staying within each stage or advancing to the next stage based on the surv_X and n-year spent within a stage year_X. The fecundity element of the matrix (top row) includes elements for fecundity and Age-0 survivorship.\n\nTable 1.

The example below illustrates how the combined probability of staying within a stage or advancing to the next stage always equals surv_X regardless of n-years in each stage. Note that the sum of the yellow cells equals 0.6 (for both fates of staying within stage or advancing to the next stage).\n\n\n\nStage-to-stage transition probabilities\n\n\nWe can continue with the working example to represent the transition matrix numerically (Table 2). The fecundity element for stage_4 is set at 45 since it accounts for the vital rates relating to maturity and Age-0 survivorship.\nNet Fecundity (stage-4) = (mat4 * events * eps * sE * s0 * sR)/int\n45 = (1 * 1 * 3,000 * 0.1 * 0.3 * 0.5)/1\n\nTable 2.
