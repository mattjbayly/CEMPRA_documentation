## About {#08_stressor_response_library-sec-about}

The stressor-response library is designed as a public reference archive to house generalizable stressor-response functions for use in the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA) tool. The functions archived in the stressor-response library are widely applicable to numerous applications and use cases.

Users of the CEMPRA tool can select a subset of stressor-response functions applicable to their study area and focal species of interest. Selected stressor-response functions can be used to construct a customized stressor-response input workbook for the CEMPRA tool. The stressor-response library is a valuable resource for reference as it can expedite assessments with shared knowledge of common impact pathways. Although a suite of default stressor-response functions is available, the stressor-response library will continually be updated with novel stressor-response functions uploaded, edited, and validated by the community of users.

## Stressor-Response Database

***Custom filters by species, stressor, endpoint etc.***

Filter library of stressor-response relationships with dynamic filters. Review stressor-response relationships and apply filters to refine search.

[![Stressor-Response Database List View](images/srlib001.png){fig-alt="gggg"}](https://mjbayly.com/stressor-response)

Click on a stressor-response relationship from the list view to switch to detail view. The detail view of each stressor-response relationship includes descriptive details, citations, data, and all other attributes. Interactive plots are included at the bottom of the page.

## Create Multi-Stressor-Response Overview Plots

Overlay stressor-response relationships to better understand similarities and discrepancies between different reference resources. In the example below we compare several different relationships between stream temperature and vital rates of Chinook Salmon. Be sure ensure that the stressor metric is the same (or comparable) between each resource. For example, mean August stream temperature vs MWAT etc.

## Download Stressor-Response Relationships

Select one or more stressor-response relationships of interest and click download. Several download formats are available including a format for the CEMPRA tool, PHABSIM, JSON, etc.

## Add, Edit, and Update the Database

Verified users can login, add, edit and update relationships. Once logged in, options appear in the detail view to edit data for relationships. New stressors can be added in the detail view.

## Stressor-Response Curve Tracing Tool

Sometimes we need to extract data in figures from older reports. This can be a tedious task, even when using software like ImageJ. A specialized online tool has been developed to upload an image (from file or clipboard), trace the mean response, sd, lower, and upper limits and extract the data in a csv file pre-formatted for the SR database and CEMPRA tool.

(Ass the link to the video tutorial for a quick demo that describes how to use the tool).
