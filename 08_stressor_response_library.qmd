## About {#08_stressor_response_library-sec-about}

The stressor-response library is designed as a public reference archive to house generalizable stressor-response functions for use in the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA) tool. The functions archived in the stressor-response library are widely applicable to numerous applications and use cases.

Users of the CEMPRA tool can select a subset of stressor-response functions applicable to their study area and focal species of interest. Selected stressor-response functions can be used to construct a customized stressor-response input workbook for the CEMPRA tool. The stressor-response library is a valuable resource for reference as it can expedite assessments with shared knowledge of common impact pathways. Although a suite of default stressor-response functions is available, the stressor-response library will continually be updated with novel stressor-response functions uploaded, edited, and validated by the community of users.

Example stressor-response functions for Coho Salmon and Steelhead responses to temperature and sediment can be found in Appendix A.

### Stressor-Response Library Schema {#08_stressor_response_library-sec-library-schema}

#### Main Folder

The Main folder is the gateway to the stressor-response library. It contains the primary database and all of the species' folders (see below).

#### Species Folders

The main SR library is initially divided into folders for each of the currently defined species in the model. If a user develops a stressor-response function for a new species, a new folder/branch should be added to the library.

#### Stressor Folders

Stressor folders are located within each of the species' folders. The stressor folders contain the stressor-response function documentation for a given species and are named as follows:

*SR curve ID_Stressor ID_Stressor Name*

#### References

Within each of the stressor folders, the references folder contains copies of all the materials cited in the stressor-response function documentation.

## Use in the Model {#08_stressor_response_library-sec-use-in-model}

The primary stressor-response library (database) contains functions as individual Excel worksheets. These Excel worksheets are used to form a custom Excel SR workbook. The SR workbook is then used as one of the main inputs in the CEMPRA (see Data Inputs).

## Stressor-Response Database {#08_stressor_response_library-sec-stressor-response-database}

We are currently developing a formal web-based stressor-response database that users will be able to access remotely. A central online hub for all stressor-response functions will streamline collaboration and allow users around the world to share, create, and edit custom stressor-response functions. An interim stressor-response library is currently hosted on the following GitHub archive:

[Stressor-Response Library on GitHub](https://github.com/mattjbayly/stressor-response-library)

*This resource link will be changed as the archive develops (please check for the most recent version of this documentation).*

Users can access the repository to get a general sense of the SR library schema and how it will connect to the CEMPRA in the future web-based database.
